<h1 id="adventuring-classes"><strong>ADVENTURING CLASSES</strong></h1>
<h2 id="assassin"><strong>ASSASSIN</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting equipment:</strong> 3 throwing knives, disguise kit,
vial of poison, contract for assassination</p>
<p><strong>A: Cold Read, Assassinate</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Poison, Opportunist</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Bet My Life, Paralyzing Poison, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Fadeaway, Pierce</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Cold read.</strong> The first time you get a good look at
someone, you can examine them to determine one of their secrets or
weaknesses at random. Can alternatively be used before combat to
determine what the opponent’s first action will be.</p>
<p><strong>A: Assassinate.</strong> For every secret or weakness of the
target’s that you know, gain +1 damage during the first round, up to
+5.</p>
<p><strong>B: Poison.</strong> Using common kitchen ingredients, you can
create a single-use vial of poison that deals 1d6 damage applied to a
weapon or in a spiked food or drink. 3 vials/slot, can’t stack
damage.</p>
<p><strong>B: Opportunist.</strong> Any time you attack with a distinct
advantage, such as from behind, while hidden, or from above, you deal an
additional 1d6 damage. This applies to attacks made while grappling.</p>
<p><strong>C: Paralyzing Poison.</strong> Using 20 gp of ingredients
purchased from criminal contacts, you can create paralyzing poison,
which paralyzes targets for 1d6 minutes on a failed <strong>Save vs
CON</strong>. Strong creatures might get new saves every minute or
round.</p>
<p><strong>C: Bet my life.</strong> Non-magical poisons that you have
added to food or drink, or your weapon, will not affect you unless you
wish.</p>
<p><strong>D: Pierce.</strong> Attacks on unaware or immobilized
opponents bypass normal armor.</p>
<p><strong>D: Fadeaway.</strong> If unengaged during combat, you may
roll a stealth check to disappear, and perform a stealth attack on your
next turn.</p>
<h2 id="alchemist"><strong>ALCHEMIST</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting equipment:</strong> Thick leather gloves, dagger,
portable mini lab (1 slot), ingredients (see below), lots of vials.</p>
<p><strong>A: Alchemy, Stabilize, Alchemical tricks</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Scrounge, Reclamation</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Potion Maker, Precise Measurements, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Discovery, Immunity</strong></p>
<p>For each template (i.e. level) of Alchemist, you can use 1 AD per
concoction (max 4). You learn two formulas per template (see below).</p>
<p><strong>A: Alchemy.</strong> An alchemist’s wondrous abilities are
powered by “special ingredients”. They could be gems, special herbs,
dragon scales, rare metals or spices… the exact nature of these can be
defined with your GM, or stay vague. A single dose of “special
ingredient” is represented by an <strong>Alchemical Dice</strong>, or
<strong>AD</strong>. These work similarly to Magic Dice (MD) or spell
dice, common to many other GLoG magic using classes.</p>
<p>An alchemist does not cast spells. They create concoctions - potions,
bombs, ointments - short term, one-use quasi-magical objects that the
alchemist uses to create magic-like effects, based on formulas they
know. The more AD the alchemist invests into a concoction, the more
powerful it will be. An alchemist therefore needs time to prepare their
concoctions in advance. An alchemist without concoctions prepared will
have to rely on their wit, dagger or feet to get out of trouble.</p>
<p>Using Concoctions: Most require 1 action to activate - light a fuse
and throw, drink, etc. When a concoction is used, one 1d6 is rolled per
AD invested during the concoction’s reaction, and the effect (for
example, damage, or duration) is based on this result. On a roll of 1-3,
the AD is “returned” to the alchemist - he was stingy with the
ingredients, and still has some left. On a 4-6 the AD is lost - more
ingredients were used for a bigger bang.</p>
<p>Other people can use your concoctions, but it is risky - they roll 2
extra d6 that add no power to the effect but can trigger a mishap or
doom (see below).</p>
<p>When rolling ADs, [sum] means the sum of the AD(s) rolled and [dice]
the number of ADs rolled. If two of the dice have the same number, it
triggers a mishaps. If three have the same number, it triggers a
doom.</p>
<p>Making concoctions: A concoction takes 1 hour per AD invested to
prepare (some take longer). This is careful work that needs quiet, some
shelter and light to do. Most alchemists carry a portable lab (2 slots)
that is sufficient for most alchemical work. If the process is
interrupted the ADs are lost. There is no limit to the number of
concoctions an alchemist can prepare - but it would not be wise for her
to use all her AD in advance, as concoctions are not stable - each
morning, the concoction has a 1 in 6 chance of losing one AD of power. A
concoction with no AD left has fully degraded and is essentially
useless. Some alchemists deal with this problem with stabilization (see
below).</p>
<p>Regaining ADs: An alchemist starts at level 1 with 2d6 ADs, and she
gains 1d6 more ADs each time she levels up. Furthermore, when returning
to town to re-supply, a level 1 alchemist <em>can</em> regain 1d4 ADs,
at a cost of 1 gp per AD. At level 2 and 3 resupplying will yield 1d6
ADs, and a master alchemist will be able to gather 1d8 ADs. An alchemist
does <em>not</em> gain ADs by sleeping or some special ceremony. (please
see design notes below!!!).</p>
<p>A skilled alchemist has also ways of obtaining more ADs by careful
use of their ingredients.</p>
<p>Formulas: An alchemist begins the game with two known formulas, each
determined randomly by rolling 1d6 and consulting the list (reroll any
duplicates). At template B they gain two more formulas (roll 1d8 twice),
at Template C they gain two more (roll 1d10 twice) and at template D
they get another two (roll 1d12 once and select another). An alchemist
can also gain further formulas by consulting alchemical tomes and
learning their formulas. Doing so is difficult, taking a day (or more!)
per new formula.</p>
<p><strong>A: Stabilize.</strong> To avoid the rapid degradation of a
prepared concoction, an alchemist can spend one hour carefully
neutralizing it. The concoction - if kept dry and away from extreme
temperatures - will remain inert and stable for several years. Another
hour of work is required to re-activate it. Once this is done, the
concoction cannot be neutralized a second time, and must be used soon or
it will degrade (as per standard rules).</p>
<p><strong>A: Alchemical tricks.</strong> You know one of the following
minor alchemical feats (and learn one per template). These do not
require CDs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Matches. You have created small fire sticks, that are useful to
start fires. You can use them to light a fire most circumstances, or
provide candle-level illumination for 1d3 rounds. If the precise number
of matches becomes important, you have 2d6*5 matches, and creating a new
batch takes 1 hour.</p></li>
<li><p>Small firework display. A sparkler or 3, a whistler, a half dozen
firecrackers, a couple of bottle rockets, a cone fountain… it will
entertain the children or make a heck of a distraction. An alchemist
investing large sums and sufficient time could make a display suitable
for larger audiences, of course.</p></li>
<li><p>Planetary Charm: A small plate of lead with protective symbols.
They provide you with a +2 save bonus vs a specific thing (fire, fear,
brigand attacks, poison, illness….). Re-aligning the save takes 1 hour
but must be done on the proper day of the week (roll 1d7 to determine
which day).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B: Scrounge.</strong> An alchemist with no remaining ADs can
spend an hour searching an area (a cavern with strange mushrooms, a
wooded area, an abandoned lich lab, even a small village) and gain 1 AD.
At template C this increased to 1d2 AD, and at template D this increases
to 1d3 AD. This can only be performed once a day. This search may
trigger random encounters. Scrounging is free, unless in a village or
the lich is still around…</p>
<p><strong>B: Reclamation</strong>: An alchemist can take apart an
already prepared concoction and extract remaining ADs from them. Roll
1d6 per AD, you regain it on a 1-4. If the concoction is not stabilized,
this roll may trigger mishaps/dooms in case of doubles or triples. This
process takes an hour.</p>
<p><strong>C: Potion Maker.</strong> You learn the craft of making
magical potions (potions of healing, giant strength etc). The exact
costs, special ingredients, special recipes etc if any, are left to your
GM to determine. You can do it twice as fast as a wizard, and probably
safer too.</p>
<p><strong>C: Precise Measurement.</strong> Instead of rolling, you can
decide that a AD will be 2 (you conserved on ingredients) or 5 (you
didn’t skimp). Not all dice can be determined at least one AD must be
random (precise measurement can only be used on 2D or stronger
concoctions). Having multiple 2s or 5s can trigger a mishap or doom.</p>
<p><strong>D: Discovery.</strong> You rediscover an ancient secret of
the past. You (THE PLAYER) do some research in old grimoires etc, find a
formula or spell you like, and transcribe it into the GLOG format. You
can do it - I mean you’re playing this class right? Your character will
thank you.</p>
<p><strong>D: Immunity.</strong> Years of exposure to strange substances
and dangerous experiments have granted you <strong>Advantage</strong> to
saves vs poison, gas, fire or acid.</p>
<p><strong>Formulas</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fire Projector</li>
</ol>
<p>This concoction is a tube that projects one or more fiery
projectiles, each doing 1d6 points of damage to target and cast light as
a torch (it can be use to set fires). It shoots [dice] number of
projectiles. Hits are automatic within 30 feet, after that an attack
roll is required (treat as a ranged weapon with range increment of 30
feet). The alchemist can set a fast fuse (shooting all projectiles in 1
round) or slow (shoot one per round). Also known as the Roman Candle.
You can choose the color of each projectile.</p>
<p>This concoction is easier to make than most, ADs are regained on 1-4,
not 1-3.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Stone Bread</li>
</ol>
<p>The alchemist uses sawdust, grass, dried leaves or similar materials
(even dirt will do) and bakes them into a “delicious” breadish substance
that is not particularly nutritious but will keep you going in times of
scarcity. Lunches does with this substance will heal half of normal.
“Bread” made this way keeps twice as long as normal bread (do not use
the degradation check). This process generates [sum] portions of
“bread.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Celestial Perfume of the Seven Planets This perfume is most
auspicious and pleasant, making the wearer seems interesting,
charismatic and worthy of assistance - if a roll is required, it
provides a +4 bonus to a charisma check (or equivalent bonus). It also
keeps miasmas and plagues at bay, providing a +2 bonus to saves vs
diseases. Gnomes are particularly fond of the perfume - they know what
it is, but its usage is seen as a mark of good character and style. Once
applied, the perfume lasts for [sum] hours.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Smoke Pot Upon ignition, this clay pot emits copious amounts of
smoke, generating a cloud of [dice] X5 feet radius, lasting [sum]/2
round (only 1 round in a stiff wind). By varying the fillers in the pot,
the alchemist can choose to generate one of two types of smoke. The
smoke can be opaque, blocking vision - the smoke is unpleasant but
mostly harmless. Or the smoke can be thinner but noxious. Those inside
the infernal stink must make a constitution save or be sickened,
suffering a -4 penalty to attack rolls and ability/skill checks while
they remain in the smoke and for [dice] thereafter.</p>
<p>An alchemist can choose to have the bomb go off almost immediately
after thrown or add a fuse that will delay its activation by up to
[dice] rounds.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Vitriol The alchemist generates [dice] vials of strong acid. This
acid can be thrown at an enemy (10 foot range increment, attack roll
required, [sum] damage on round 1 and [dice] damage for the following
[dice] rounds). It can also be used to destroy metals (gold is immune) -
a single vial is sufficient to wreck a lock, melt an iron bar etc, in
about a minute.</p>
<p>This concoction is particularly stable, and only requires a check vs
degradation every month.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Theriac</li>
</ol>
<p>The alchemist takes a large onion, cuts off the top and carefully
opens it up. Spices, poisons and other exotic ingredients are inserted
between the layers, and the whole thing is slowly and gently cooked in
boiling honey. Some alchemists believe that keeping a stabilized Theriac
for very long periods of time (years or even decades) enhances the
effect - the flavor certainly is something.</p>
<p>This powerful concoction can stop illness or poison dead in their
tracks. Upon eating this panacea, the patient may remake a save vs
illness or poison with a +4 bonus. Furthermore, they regain 1d3 hp per
AD used.</p>
<p>The Theriac takes two hours per AD to prepare, not one.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>The Great Petard</li>
</ol>
<p>A metal sphere or tube (or a very thick glass bottle) is filled with
fiery ingredients, a fuse is lit, and KABOOM. Does [sum] damage in a 20
feet radius. If well placed against a structure (gate etc) does double
damage to the structure (DM should be generous in its breaching power.
Something like 1 D will blow up a solid door, 2D a postern, 3D a stout
postern or a small gate 4D all but the greatest gates). The bomb can be
thrown up to 50 feet with a running start. The fuse can be almost
immediate, or burn for up to [dice]X2 rounds.</p>
<p>This was used by Kerbouchar in The Walking Drum - that guy was pirate
<em>and</em> a scholar.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Sword of St Germain</li>
</ol>
<p>This concoction is a bit different from most. A 7 pointed star made
of a thin sheet of pure tin is inscribed with potent symbols under the
light of the full moon. This star must then be wrapped around the tang
of a single handed sword (preferably a backsword). The grip is then
re-installed over the star.</p>
<p>The star will be inert (and stable) for several years until its power
is invoked. The user will then be victorious in battle. The sword
becomes a +2 weapon for [sum] hours, but only for the alchemist.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>Mercury invisibility ring</li>
</ol>
<p>This ring is made with solidified quicksilver and mounted with a
small stone found in the nest of a hoopoe (a type of bird). To be used,
the ring must be worn with the stone facing outwards - by wearing it
with the stone hidden, its power is suppressed. The invisibility granted
by the ring lasts [sum]+[dice] minutes, but it can be split up into up
to [dice] uses. A violent action by the alchemist, the use of magic,
rapid motion (running vs walking) or even loud speech by the alchemist
will disrupt the invisibility for 1d6 rounds. Despite these limitations,
the power of such a ring cannot be overstated, and could even be used to
win a kingdom.</p>
<p>This concoction does not expire (i.e. is stable) until it time/number
of uses runs out, when the ring melts. This concoction <em>must</em> be
prepared on a Wednesday.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>Killing Miasma</li>
</ol>
<p>In a glass bottle, the alchemist mixes water, salt, distilled
vinegar, old urine, styrax and other things, and exposes it to the light
of the sun, then seals with with a good cork and bee’s wax. Upon
breaking, the vial releases a cloud of noxious fumes, [dice]X5 feet
radius, lasting [sum]/2 round. While a strong wind will disperse the
cloud in a single round, a gentle breeze will push it along, moving it
1d3X10 feet per round. Anyone inside the cloud take [dice] damage.
Furthermore, anyone in the fumes for longer than their hit dice (or
level) rounds must make a save vs death (or constitution check) or die.
Woe upon the alchemist who breaks his bottle by accident. It can be
thrown up to 40 feet, 60 with a running start.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>Homunculus</li>
</ol>
<p>The alchemist has gained mastery over life itself! Using clay, bile
and a drop of her blood; and with a full day of sculpting and gentle
baking, she has created a new living organism, the homunculus.</p>
<p>The homunculus can speak the creator’s native tongue. It is not
particularly intelligent but is cunning and is able to improvise. It is
fairly loyal as long as it’s treated reasonably well. Its life span and
potency depends on how many CDs were invested:</p>
<p>1D Defense zero (AC 10), 3 HP, +0 to hit, 1d4 dmg All stats 8. Lives
[sum] hours 2D Defense 2 (leather), HP 5, +1 to hit, 1d6 dmg, +4 to
stealth check, All stats 10. Lives [sum] days 3D Defense 3, HP 8, +2 to
hit, 1d6 dmg, stealth as above + can use a bow. All stats 11, Lives,
[sum] weeks 4D Defense 3, HP 12, +3 to hit, 1d6 dmg, stealth and magic
as above, can fly mediocrely on batwings, all stats 12, lives [dice]
years + [sum] weeks. Can use your concoctions.</p>
<p>Alchemists hotly contest claims that they are merely hiring small
ugly(er) goblins.</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>Philosopher’s stone.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Grand Work. Takes a full month and <em>must</em> invest 4 AD for
it to work, along with a pound of lead, a pound of silver and one
thousand ants, as well as access to a full alchemical lab - a portable
one simply won’t do. Through a series of sublimations, condensations,
combustions, fermentations, precipitations and paying close attention to
planetary alignments, the alchemist prepares the philosopher’s stone,
the culmination of his art, a golden brown stone the size of a baby’s
fist. This stone is stable until used.</p>
<p>But what does it do?!?</p>
<p>Some say that when crushed and mixed with a pound of lead, it will
generate a pound of gold.</p>
<p>Some say that if put in the mouth of a creature that recently died
(no more than a week ago), the creature will be resurrected.</p>
<p>Some say that if shallowed by a dragon, the stone will allow it to
assume human form for [sum] days, and that dragons will grant anyone
bringing them such a stone a wish.</p>
<p>Some say that that if dissolved in a perfect alcohol then drunk, it
will instantly grant a wizard template to the drinker.</p>

<h2 id="barbarian"><strong>BARBARIAN</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment</strong>: heavy weapon, light armor, beast
mount.</p>
<p><strong>A: Rage, +2 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Danger Sense, Weird Herbs, +2 HP, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Feat of Strength, Die Hard, +2 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Tough, Extra Attack, +2 HP, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p>You gain +2 HP for each Barbarian template you possess. You cannot
wear heavy armor.</p>
<p><strong>A: Rage.</strong> You can choose to enter a rage at the start
of your turn, or in response to taking damage. While in a rage, you have
+1 to attack, all your melee attacks inflict +2 damage, and you are
immune to pain and fear. You might froth, or stare in battle-focus, or
merely let a facade drop and give in to your ancient urges, brutal
warrior training, or religious fanaticism.</p>
<p>While raging, you cannot do anything defensive, curative, or tactical
with your allies. All you can do is attempt to kill things. Spellcasting
is not impossible, but all your spells must be damaging spells, which
deal +2 damage (if single target) or +1 damage (if multiple targets).
Mishaps and Dooms may be more severe.</p>
<p>While raging, you cannot stop fighting until you kill, subdue, or
drive off all enemies. If one of your allies has injured you this fight,
they count as an enemy.</p>
<p>While raging, you ignore any effects of <strong>Fatigue</strong>.</p>
<p>You can make a <strong>WIS save</strong> at the start of your turn as
a free action to end the Rage.</p>
<p>Once your Rage ends, you gain 1 level of
<strong>Fatigue</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>B: Danger Sense.</strong> If you are surprised, you have a
3-in-6 chance to act on the surprise round anyway. If you encounter a
creature no one in the group has seen before, you can make an INT save
to remember a weakness or detail about them, provided the creature is
not unique.</p>
<p><strong>B: Weird Herbs.</strong> You can consume a special ration to
regain 25% of your total HP. This takes 1 round. One use costs 5gp and
can be purchased in any trading city. 3 “doses” fit in a single
inventory slot. You don’t share, and your companions are in no hurry to
sample your weird herbs.</p>
<p>You cannot do this while raging, but you can immediately enter a rage
after eating the herbs. If reduced to 0 HP and an ally waves the herbs
under you nose, you can make a <strong>CON Save</strong> to wake up with
1HP and do not gain a Scar. You may play a theme tune (or a leitmotif,
if you’re classy).</p>
<p><strong>C: Feat of Strength.</strong> Once per combat as a free
action, you have advantage on STR saves for 1 round. Can also be used in
combat (advantage to-hit, +4 damage).</p>
<p><strong>C: Die Hard.</strong> Once per day when you are reduced to 0
HP or below, you stay on your feet with 1 HP. After [level] rounds you
drop to 0 HP until you can get a <strong>Good Night’s Rest</strong>.
Roll on the Scars Table.</p>
<p><strong>D: Tough.</strong> Reduce all incoming damage by 2 points but
never below 1. You gain a +2 to Save vs mind-altering spells and fear
effects.</p>
<p><strong>NOTES ON THE BARBARIAN</strong> Fighters are all about damage
output. Barbarians soak damage instead. They have high HP and the unique
ability to heal in combat.</p>
<p>Barbarians don’t need to be half-naked fur wearing brutes. If your
game is set in a world modeled on 13th Century China, they might be a
Christian knight from France. Barbarians are just outsiders. People from
Foreign Parts; and folks Around Here are laughably ignorant of their
culture.</p>

<h2 id="bard"><strong>BARD</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment</strong>: gaudy clothing, musical
instrument, d6 gold, an empty book</p>
<p><strong>A: Gossip, A Bard Knows Things</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Inspire, Storyteller</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Bardic Immunity, Relax, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Tale of Monsters</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Gossip</strong> When you sing a song (or tell a tale)
about something in a public place, everyone in the area knows about it
within one week. When you talk to someone, <strong>save vs
Charisma</strong> to see if they believe it. If your song was extra
good, or if the person is especially gullible/savvy, you may have
advantage/disadvantage or skip the roll entirely.</p>
<p><strong>A: A Bard Knows Things.</strong> When you encounter a new
location, npc, monster, or treasure that could possibly have been
written about somewhere, you know three fun facts about it.</p>
<p><strong>B: Inspire.</strong> Before another player rolls, use your
action to play a song for them (or give them some words of
encouragement), which gives them advantage (roll twice, use best) on
their roll. Uses per day equal to your number of Bard templates.</p>
<p><strong>B: Storyteller.</strong> Once per session you can tell a
convincing lie. This can’t be about something impossible, but it should
be believable within reason. You can also detect lies with ease
(<strong>Advantage</strong> on WIS saves to detect lies).</p>
<p><strong>C: Bardic Immunity.</strong> Once per session, if you would
be killed, you can weasel your way out of it somehow.</p>
<p><strong>C: Relax.</strong> Once per day, you can play especially
relaxing music (or an engaging story). Allies who can hear you regain
1d4 HP. This is non-magical healing. If you use this ability out of
combat, allies instead gain 2d4 + your Charisma bonus HP.</p>
<p><strong>D: Tale of Monsters</strong> Sing about a type of monster,
including one fact (weakness) you make up about it, which is now true.
Takes at least 10 minutes. Uses per session equal to your number of Bard
templates. The GM may deny this ability if your claims are ridiculous,
irrelevant, or conflict with known information. After your song, if it’s
plausible, there’s a 3-in-6 chance that you encounter the monster
immediately.</p>
<h2 id="beastmaster"><strong>BEASTMASTER</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment</strong>: Razor Boomerang, light armor,
spice pouch</p>
<p><strong>A: Beast Companion, Beast-Fang Boomerang, +1 BD, +1 HP
</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Feline Reflexes, +1 BD, +1 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Nine Lives Gauntlet, Sight Beyond Sight, +1 BD, +1 HP, +1
To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Beastly Cuisine, Boomerang Mastery, +1 BD, +1
HP</strong></p>
<p>You gain +1 HP and +1 BD (Beast Dice) for each Beastmaster template
you possess.</p>
<p><strong>A: Beast Companion.</strong> You begin play with a big
fucking beast companion (BFB). Its exact species is hard to identify.
Add a few visual quirks of your own (ex. Strange color and/or markings,
weird ears, extra set of limbs). If it dies or leaves, it is possible to
befriend a new one. The process requires petting a large number of very
dangerous animals. Beast companions cannot fly.</p>
<p><strong>A: Beast-Fang Boomerang.</strong> This boomerang has a range
of 50ft and does 1d6+STR damage before returning to your hand. People
without this ability can still throw boomerangs, but the boomerang does
not return and does not benefit from the STR bonus.</p>
<p>The Beast-Fang can be wielded in melee combat like a dagger or hand
axe.</p>
<p>If a boomerang doesn’t suit your style, you can reflavor the
weapon.</p>
<p><strong>B: Feline Reflexes.</strong> You have advantage on
<strong>DEX saves vs attacks/damage</strong>, as long as you can see the
attack coming. If a success would 1⁄2 the damage, you instead take no
damage.</p>
<p>Treat fall distance as half for determining damage.</p>
<p><strong>C: Nine Lives Gauntlet.</strong> Your Beast Companion can
morph into a bracer/gauntlet. This bracer protects as a +1 magic shield.
Requires a free hand (as a mundane shield). It takes up no item slot. It
can morph back into its Beast form only after you get a <strong>Good
Night’s Rest</strong>.</p>
<p>When wearing your claw shield and a physical ranged attack would hit
you, make a <strong>DEX save</strong>. On a success you block the
attack. If the die result (before Ability Bonus is applied) is 18 or
higher you deflect the shot back on your attacker. No attack roll is
required. You can do this once per encounter.</p>
<p><strong>C: Sight Beyond Sight.</strong> You can sense (but not see)
invisible creatures within 15ft. This lets you pinpoint their location.
You also get a sense of their movements, so if they are moving their
limbs, you can attack them without penalty.</p>
<p><strong>D: Beastly Cuisine.</strong> In their youth, Beastmasters are
not allowed to pick up a weapon until they have mastered the culinary
skills of their ancestors.</p>
<p>Beastmasters are adept at turning slain beasts into tasty meals.
Monster rations prepared by a Beastmaster restore an additional 1d4HP at
Lunch.</p>
<p><strong>D: Boomerang Mastery</strong>. When you throw a boomerang, it
can hit any number of unique targets before returning to your hand. All
targets must be within 50ft of you and have clear lines between them.
Make an attack roll against each target in order. If the attack misses,
all subsequent attacks also miss and the boomerang returns to your
hand.</p>
<p><strong>BIG FUCKIN’ BEAST–BFB</strong> The exact nature of what a BFB
is remains unknown. Scholars that ask too many questions have been known
to lose their heads to razor boomerangs.</p>
<p>BFB have the same 5+ [5HP X number of Beastmaster templates], +1
attack bonus per Beastmaster template, and AC 11 +[number of Beastmaster
templates]. For purposes of saves, assume that their physical Abilities
are 2 higher than their Beastmaster’s, and their mental Abilities are 2
lower.</p>
<p>For every Beastmaster template you possess you gain +1 Beast Die (BD,
also known as Meowgic Dice). They function in the same way as Magic
Dice.</p>
<p>The BFB is a companion and ally, but definitely has a mind of its
own. It takes your action to give BFB an order. Thereafter it will act
autonomously until you give it a new order.</p>
<p>Roll your Beast Dice to give it orders, with BFB gaining +[dice]
bonus to the task and doing [sum] damage or affecting [sum] targets
depending on the nature of the command.</p>
<p>For each Beastmaster template that you possess there is a 1-in-6
chance the BFB will do something that benefits you between received
orders. (4-in-6 maximum.)</p>
<p>BFB is neither stupid nor suicidal. If you ask it to do something
because you clearly want to avoid the risk yourself, you automatically
suffer a BFB Doom.</p>
<p>BD that roll 1-3 return to your casting pool and can be used again
that day. Dice that roll 4-6 are removed from your casting pool for the
day. You can use your abilities any number of times per day provided you
have BD to invest. Your BD return if you get a Good Night’s Rest. If you
didn’t sleep well, make a WIS save for each BD to have them return to
your pool anyway.</p>
<p>BFB grows from lynx to liger sized with each template that you
possess. Once you obtain Template D, BFB is large enough to be ridden as
a mount. Assuming they want you to ride them. Sometimes they definitely
won’t be in the mood.</p>
<p>Rolling doubles on your BD creates a BFB Mishap.</p>
<p>Rolling triples on your BD summons a BFB Doom.</p>
<p>If BFB drops below 0HP it dies and you suffer the stunned condition
for 1d6 rounds.</p>
<p><strong>BFB MISHAPS</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>BD return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24hrs</p></li>
<li><p>BFBt swats you for 1d6 damage.</p></li>
<li><p>Hack up a hair ball each round. You are capable of no other
actions. CON Save to end.</p></li>
<li><p>BFB Judged you. Lose 1 BD for 24 hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Suffer the Fatigue condition for 1d6 rounds.</p></li>
<li><p>BFB ignores you for 1d6 rounds.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>DOOM OF THE BFB</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>BFB vanishes on Beast Business for 1 day.</p></li>
<li><p>BFB vanishes on Beast Business for 3 days.</p></li>
<li><p>BFB is called away permanently by the King of Beasts.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You cannot bond with a new beast until BFB dies or you both ritually
end your relationship. This doom can be undone by entering the Feywild
and petitioning the King of Beasts to release BFB from service. This is
extremely dangerous as the King of Beasts is both fickle and cruel. You
will likely be quested to aid BFB in whatever impossible task they have
been commanded to accomplish.</p>
<h2 id="captain"><strong>CAPTAIN</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> Medium armor, longsword,
officer’s helmet.</p>
<p><strong>A: Notches, Command, +2 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Parry, Rallying Cry, +1 HP, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Riposte, Mark Foe, +1 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Leader of Men, Call to Arms, +1 HP, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Notches.</strong> Each time you attain a total of 10, 20,
30, and 50 kills with a weapon type (such as 10 kills with a dagger),
you unlock a new ability for that weapon, chosen from the list below.
Keep track of your kills and special abilities on the back of your
character sheet. The GM decides what counts as a kill.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>+1 Damage</p></li>
<li><p>Expanded critical range (+1)</p></li>
<li><p>Special ability (negotiated with GM, one per weapon).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Examples: ability to draw the weapon from any slot, wield a
two-handed weapon in one hand, gain a bonus to use the weapon as a tool,
etc.</p>
<p>For example, a Fighter with 50 flail kills (4 notches) could have +1
damage, a critical range of (18-20), and the ability to stun an opponent
for one round on a critical hit.</p>
<p><strong>A: Command.</strong> You can use your action to give one of
your allies the opportunity to strike an enemy during your turn.</p>
<p><strong>B: Parry.</strong> Once per combat, force an opponent to
reroll their attack against you.</p>
<p><strong>B: Rallying Cry.</strong> Once per day, you can use an action
to rally one of your allies (they need to be able to hear you). They
regain 1d8+level HP.</p>
<p><strong>C: Riposte.</strong> Once per round when you are struck by an
enemy, make an immediate attack in return.</p>
<p><strong>C: Mark Foe.</strong> You can mark an enemy as a target for
your allies. Until your next turn, all attacks on the marked foe have
<strong>Advantage</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>D: Leader of Men.</strong> You gain two hirelings for free.
They are particularly loyal to you and make morale checks with
<strong>Advantage</strong>. Your hirelings may also reroll a failed
<strong>save vs fear</strong>. If they die, you can recruit a new
hireling in a town within 1 day.</p>
<p><strong>D: Call to Arms.</strong> You and your allies (within 30 ft)
roll <strong>Initiative</strong> with <strong>Advantage</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="chef"><strong>CHEF</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> chef’s tools (knives, ladle,
sieve, etc., 1 slot bundle), spices (0 slots, 5 uses), pots &amp; pans
(2 slots).</p>
<p><strong>A: Fillet, Foraging, Monster Chef</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Seasoned Wok, Spices</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Magical Harvest, Make Delicious, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Feast, Stewpot Familiar</strong></p>
<p>You gain +1 save vs poison for every Chef template that you
possess.</p>
<p><strong>A: Fillet.</strong> You know how to carve up a piece of meat.
When attacking with a chef’s knife (1d6 damage, 1/2 slots, 1 hand, 15
gp, 15ft(thrown), not concealable, Bleed), you gain an extra +1 to
damage.</p>
<p><strong>A: Foraging.</strong> It’s not all owlbear stew and giant
centipede tar-tar. Spend 1 Turn to find enough edible plants, mushrooms,
lichens, fruit, and roots to feed 1d4+4 people a single meal.
<strong>Save vs Wisdom</strong> if attempting to locate a specific
ingredient.</p>
<p><strong>A: Monster Chef.</strong> You’ve learned to prepare and
preserve the flora and fauna of the dungeon. Create an additional 1d6
rations from any monsters that you butcher. Rations last an additional
day.</p>
<p>Make an <strong>INT Save</strong> to determine the medicinal and
culinary qualities of unfamiliar ingredients, potions, and similar
concoctions.</p>
<p>The <strong>INT Save</strong> also allows you to tell tell if a
ingredient will be outright poisonous to eat. Keeping a recipe book of
these discoveries negates the need for an <strong>INT Save</strong> in
the future, but only if the player keeps notes.</p>
<p><strong>B: Seasoned Wok.</strong> Your assortment of pots, pans, and
platters, function as armor (as Ring Mail). Increase this bonus by +1
for every additional Chef template that you possess. Does not stack with
actual armor.</p>
<p><strong>B: Spices:</strong> You know which spices pair best with
which ingredients. Any rations or meals that you prepare with spices
provide an additional 1d6 HP.</p>
<p><strong>C: Magical Harvest.</strong> If a creature possesses valuable
parts (poison glands, spore sacks, etc.) you may harvest them for use or
sale without a roll. All others must make a <strong>DEX Save</strong> or
destroy the valuable component.</p>
<p><strong>C: Make Delicious.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: Touch, T: creature, D: 1 Turn</em></p>
<p>Target creature becomes delicious and irresistible to those around
them. The smell radiates 20’ in calm air, but can spread via wind or
leave a trail. Pass a <strong>WIS Save</strong> or be compelled to
attack the target.</p>
<p>Intelligent creatures make the save with advantage. Unintelligent
creatures make the save with disadvantage.</p>
<p><strong>D: Feast.</strong> By combining exotic ingredients you can
create a meal that has magical effects. Requires a Lunch or Good Night’s
Sleep to prepare. Feeds up to 8 people.</p>
<p>It takes an entire day of searching to locate an exotic ingredient.
You have a 2-in-6 chance of locating a specific ingredient and a 5-in-6
chance of finding a random exotic ingredient. Magical creatures count as
exotic ingredients.</p>
<p>You may combine a number of exotic ingredients equal to your level in
a single feast. Leftovers spoil after 24hrs.</p>
<p><strong>D: Stewpot Familiar.</strong> Enough magical material has
been rendered, reduced, and simmered in your favorite pot that it is
alive now. It’s only about as smart as the average spell, but it will
grow sly and cunning as it ages. If it has hands (3-in-6 chance) it will
hold a torch or lantern for you.</p>
<p>The pot had an outrageous face worked into its surface and it
ambulates on stubby iron legs. If it squats over flammable material they
bursts into flame, bringing the pot and its contents to cooking
temperature in one minute. The pot will keep contents warm
indefinitely.</p>
<p>Though normally small enough to be carried on your belt, the stewpot
familiar can expand to cook creatures of HD equal to your level. It
returns to its portable size when its greater capacity is no longer
needed. In battle a pot familiar can spill its contents on your enemies,
inflicting 1d8 damage in a 5’ wide, 15’ long scalding yet delicious
wave. <strong>DEX Save</strong> to dodge out of the way. If full, it can
do this a number of times equal to your level.</p>
<p>It can also ram a target, inflicting 1d6 damage. Apply your
<strong>INT bonus</strong> to attack rolls. Medium sized or small
creatures must <strong>save vs Strength</strong> or be tipped into the
pot. If empty this I merely inconvenient. If full, the victim takes 1d8
damage until dead or it can make a successful <strong>STR Save</strong>.
Victims so boiled are rendered down into a delicious broth.</p>
<p>It takes your action to give such a command and you roll to-hit using
your <strong>INT bonus</strong>.</p>
<p>Stewpot familiars have armor AC16 and twice as many HP as their Chef.
If a stewpot familiar is reduced to 0HP it explodes for 3d6 damage in a
10’ radius, <strong>DEX Save</strong> for half. If the gourmand
survives, they must retire in shame for allowing such harm to befall a
priceless cooking aid. They take the worst job in a tavern scullery
where they are barked at constantly by a loud but talentless sous-chef
for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p><strong>EXOTIC INGREDIENTS TABLE</strong></p>
<p>Roll a D12 five times on the chart below to create a random exotic
ingredient. Making a note of it in your recipe book means that you have
a 3-in-6 chance of finding when you wish to add it to a
<strong>feast</strong>. Example roll: 3, 7, 2, 5, 12= Blue Skinned
Bitter Leaf that grants Visions.</p>

<p>CHEF NOTES Inspired chef, practical dungeoneer, or deranged
survivalist doom-prepper lunatic? Who can say! Whatever the reasons, you
are obsessed and inspired by the bounty of the untamed wilds and sunken
otherworldly dungeons.</p>
<p>You delve into dungeons to challenge yourself and discover new and
amazing flavor experiences. You fight with clever and knife, billhook
and orchard pole, the herb cutting sickle. You have mastered the
strangle chord and for hunting small game, the sling.</p>
<p>Exploration and discover are a key motivation for this class but it
is also a force-multiplier on any long journey into uncivilized parts.
Keeping the party fed and healed is what monster gourmands do best. You
don’t have much in the way of combat prowess, though your stewpot
familiar does. Just be careful not to imperil her too much. Also be
careful what you turn into broth inside her. Eating intelligent
humanoids, regardless of ancestry, is still cannibalism. 1- in-6 chance
of becoming a Ghoul (party members) or Elder Ghoul (you).</p>
<h2 id="fighter"><strong>FIGHTER</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> light armor, bow, 20 arrows, and
a melee weapon of choice.</p>
<p><strong>A: Grit, Notches, +3 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Campaigner, Savvy Fighter, +1 HP, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Riposte, Parry, +1 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Savage Strike, Girded Loins, Extra Attack, +1 HP, +1
To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Grit.</strong> When <strong>pushing yourself</strong> in
combat, you can ignore the first instance of <strong>Fatigue</strong> in
that fight.</p>
<p><strong>A: Notches.</strong> Each time you attain a total of 10, 20,
30, and 50 kills with a weapon type (such as 10 kills with a dagger),
you unlock a new ability for that weapon, chosen from the list below.
Keep track of your kills and special abilities on the back of your
character sheet. The GM decides what counts as a kill.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>+1 Damage</p></li>
<li><p>Expanded critical range (+1)</p></li>
<li><p>Special ability (negotiated with GM, one per weapon).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Examples: ability to draw the weapon from any slot, wield a
two-handed weapon in one hand, gain a bonus to use the weapon as a tool,
etc.</p>
<p>For example, a Fighter with 50 flail kills (4 notches) could have +1
damage, a critical range of (18-20), and the ability to stun an opponent
for one round on a critical hit.</p>
<p><strong>B: Campaigner.</strong> Armor occupies 2 fewer item slots in
your inventory.</p>
<p><strong>B: Savvy Fighter.</strong> You gain +2 on all Combat Maneuver
rolls.</p>
<p>On a critical success you may also make a free attack against the
target of your combat maneuver or another enemy within range of your
weapon.</p>
<p>You cannot move to use this free attack against a nearby enemy, but
if you have a dagger or hand-axe in a quick-draw item slot you can use
it to make a ranged attack against anyone in range.</p>
<p>You can also come up with your own Combat maneuvers (with GM
approval). A maneuver typically requires a successful attack roll or
Save.</p>
<p><strong>C: Parry.</strong> Once per combat, force an opponent to
reroll their attack against you.</p>
<p><strong>C: Riposte.</strong> Once per round when you are struck by an
enemy, make an immediate attack in return.</p>
<p><strong>D: Savage Strikes.</strong> You only deal 0 damage on a
critical miss. On a regular miss, you hit your target with a
<strong>Glance</strong>. A <strong>Glance</strong> causes <strong>STR
mod</strong> points of damage. You should add any flat bonuses from
class abilities or magic items. Targets with HD/Levels two levels above
the PC are unaffected by this ability.</p>
<p><strong>D: Girded Loins.</strong> Once per combat, reduce the damage
from an attack made against you by half. You have advantage to
<strong>save vs fear</strong>. Hirelings get a +2 to morale and may
reroll a failed <strong>save vs fear</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTES ON THE FIGHTER</strong></p>
<p>Fighters are the base from which most other Fantasy Adventure Game
classes are built out from or measured against. Violence is the only
real tool in your inventory, but you wield it masterfully.</p>
<p>Your Grit, Extra Attack, Savvy Fighter, Riposte, Savage Strike,
Notches provide a suit of abilities for dealing out massive damage every
round in combat.</p>
<p>Campaigner lets you load up on heavy armor, while Parry, Girded
Loins, and Shields Will Be Broken (page 10) make it difficult to land a
blow on you in the first place.</p>
<p>“Every adventurer can hold their own in a fight. Those who can’t are
already dead. But you have mastered the gruesome art of combat. You are
a professional and war is your craft. You are always eager to learn new
tricks and techniques.</p>
<p>Fighters are one of the most stable and survivable classes. At Level
1, you have 2 attacks, +1 HP, and the ability to reduce incoming damage.
That’s pretty ridiculous.</p>
<p>This is a trap. All the Fighter abilities are designed to trick you
into fighting. People who fight, die. Eventually your fighter is going
to pick their last fight.” - coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com</p>

<h2 id="hunter"><strong>HUNTER</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> bow, 40 arrows, dagger, light
armor. You cannot wear heavy armor.</p>
<p><strong>A: Rangefinder, Wilderness Sense, +1 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Monster Chef, Quick Shot, +1 HP, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Traps, Monster Slayer, +1 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Impossible Shot, Vanish, +1 HP, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Rangefinder.</strong> If you miss with a ranged attack,
your next shot is made with advantage.</p>
<p><strong>A: Wilderness Sense.</strong> Advantage on <strong>WIS
saves</strong> to forage, stalk, and navigate in wilderness areas. After
the Referee gives you the omen for an encounter, you can choose to
follow the trail/clues.</p>
<p>You have a 50% chance of encountering the monster or its lair. There
is a 50% chance the lair is empty. Lairs usually contain treasure.</p>
<p><strong>B: Monster Chef.</strong> You’ve learned to prepare and
preserve monsters that you’ve hunted before (you must keep track of
this). Rations created this way provide an additional 1d4 HP.</p>
<p>Make an <strong>INT Save</strong> to tell if a new monster will be
outright poisonous to eat. You can also make an educated guess about the
extra effects of consuming magical creatures.</p>
<p><strong>B: Quick Shot.</strong> If you do not move on your turn you
may make an additional attack with a ranged weapon. Your first attack
must have been made with the same weapon.</p>
<p>If using a crossbow or other weapon requiring 1 or more rounds to
reload, take only one shot, but ignore the reload time.</p>
<p><strong>C: Traps.</strong> You can craft and set traps. It takes one
Turn to craft a trap. Traps can be set immediately or carried with you,
(taking up 1 Inventory Slot). Enemies that walk into your trap must make
a <strong>DEX save</strong> with disadvantage or suffer its effects.</p>
<p><strong>C: Monster Slayer.</strong> Once per day, you can cause one
of your physical attacks to deal +X damage, where X is equal to the HD
of the highest level monster your party has ever slain (you must keep
track of this). If you miss, this ability is not expended.</p>
<p><strong>D: Impossible Shot.</strong> Once per combat, you can make an
impossible shot with a ranged weapon. The attack automatically hits,
provided the target is within 2x the weapon’s listed range. The attack
can bounce around corners, cut a coin in half, or part a single hair on
a target’s head.</p>
<p><strong>D: Vanish.</strong> If you are in dense forest, hills, caves,
or other terrain with abundant line-of- sight blocking features, you can
choose to vanish. While vanished you cannot affect the world or be
affected by it. This ability is limited by plausibility. You can
reappear at any time by climbing down a tree, walking over a hill,
emerging from a shrub, etc.</p>
<p><strong>NOTES ON THE HUNTER</strong> Rangers are weird. Are they
monster hunters? Survivalists with fierce animal companions? Arcane
warriors, or just another flavor of the Fighter? Fantasy Adventure games
have never quite pinned this down and it shows in most implementations
of the class.</p>
<p>The Hunter is the wilderness expert/monster slayer.</p>
<p>Wilderness Sense, Monster Hunter, and Vanish provide a great amount
of utility when in wild lands -of which 90% of most fantasy worlds

<p>You are fairly tough but you thrive on the periphery of a fight where
your many ranged abilities can be brought into play.</p>
<p>Crippling Shot has great utility as a means to control the
battlefield but, possibly more importantly, it is almost a free “We run
away from the big scary monster!” skill.</p>

<h2 id="knight"><strong>KNIGHT</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> chainmail, shield, sword, horse,
10 sp</p>
<p><strong>A: Challenge, Parry +2HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Bodyguard, Chivalry +1HP, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Cleave, Squire, +1HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Aura of Courage, Dragon Slayer, Extra Attack, +1HP, +1
To-Hit</strong></p>
<p>You gain +1 to <strong>Save vs Fear</strong> for each Knight template
you possess.</p>
<p><strong>A: Challenge.</strong> This ability only works on creatures
that can understand you and are capable of being offended. If you
challenge a creature outside of combat, they must make Save to resist
accepting. In civilized areas, this is basically a duel, and this means
that you and the other party must agree upon the time, the place, the
weapons, the victory condition, and the stakes. Leaders will usually
send out a champion to fight in their stead (if applicable). In combat,
you can challenge one creature each turn by yelling at it as a free
action. The creature must <strong>Save vs WIS</strong>. If they fail,
they will attack you. This ability cannot force an opponent to make
major tactical errors or leap off cliffs.</p>
<p><strong>A: Parry.</strong> Once per combat, force an opponent to
reroll their attack against you.</p>
<p><strong>B: Bodyguard</strong> If an adjacent ally would take damage
from a physical attack, you can choose to take the damage for them. This
ability has a 4-in-6 chance of succeeding.</p>
<p><strong>B: Chivalry.</strong> You can call on the code of chivalry.
This can be used to invoke guest rights, the favorable treatment by
nobles and their attendants, or the calling of duels. In turn, you also
have to live by the Code of Chivalry. You cannot turn down requests to
help the helpless.</p>
<p><strong>C: Cleave.</strong> When you reduce a creature to 0HP with an
attack, make another attack with the same weapon against a target within
range of you. You can cleave a number of targets equal to your level in
a single round.</p>
<p><strong>C: Squire.</strong> You gain a loyal squire. Use simple
hireling statistics but they are willing to fight and receive the PC’s
<strong>CHA mod</strong> to their morale saves. The PC has to pay for
their gear and rations.</p>
<p><strong>D: Aura of Courage.</strong> Adjacent allies can use your
Save vs Fear in place of their own. This ability has no effect if you
are currently afraid.</p>
<p><strong>D: Dragon Slayer.</strong> Once per day, you can cause one of
your physical attacks to deal +X damage, where X is equal to the HD of
the highest level monster your party has ever killed. You must keep
track of this. If you miss, this ability is not expended.</p>
<h2 id="landsknecht"><strong>LANDSKNECHT</strong></h2>
<p>You are the backbone of the army or your mercenary company. You have
been in the shit and lived to see another day. Nothing phases you. A
warm meal, a good nap, and a comfortable pair of shoes is all you
need—if it weren’t for these damned officers…</p>
<p>Starting Equipment: Slightly ridiculous old-fashioned uniform (as
leather), an iron ringsword (medium), a snapchance and powderhorn, good
pair of boots, excellent backpack, one other piece of kit of your
choice.</p>
<p><strong>A: Tall Tales, Nonplussed, +1 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Respect, Notches, +1 HP, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Old Friends, Savvy Fighter, +1 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Nose for Trouble, Riposte, Extra Attack, +1 HP, +1
To-Hit</strong></p>
<p>For every template you have in this class you gain +1 inventory slot
and +1 HP. If you have at least one template of Veteran, you cannot
fumble with mundane weapons and can wear light and medium armor.</p>
<p><strong>A: Tall Tales.</strong> You’ve been everywhere, man. Roll
3d12 on the following table of mostly-true things you did before
becoming an adventurer and record the results. If you roll the same
result twice, take your choice of the one above or below.</p>

ghost towns which threatened your supply lines. This was treacherous
work, and you still have nightmares about an encounter with a cobold in
the cellar of a church. You can smell a human corpse from two hundred

difference between a dark room which is silent and a dark room in which
someone is not making a sound.</td>

famous pre-dawn raid over a broad, deep river. Half of your force was
swept away and drowned, but the enemy was taken entirely by surprise,

officers will have learned about this raid in the academy. You have a +4

items by tasting them, and you get an extra save against any Command
spell.</td>

<td><strong>Waded Ankle-Deep in Blood.</strong> You took part in an
infamous blockade of a fortified city. The six-month siege resulted in
the destruction of the walls and the slaughter of the inhabitants, which
caused a mass-rising of the Unburied. The city is abandoned to this day
and the survivors curse your name. You can identify the value of a

thief.</td>

find the boy again, you probably won’t get the full benefit of this tall
tale.</td>

in a fortified city, cut off from supplies of food and water. When all

this as anyone. Outside of combat, people just assume you are where you
belong unless given a compelling reason not to.</td>

<td><strong>Killed Three Men With One Shot.</strong> This one is also
not true. You shot one man who was at the top of a tall ladder, and he
knocked two others off as he fell. If you roll a critical hit with a
firearm you make a ballistically improbable shot. The target you hit
moves up to 10’ in any direction you choose, including straight up. It’s
the Dungeon Master’s problem to explain how this is possible.</td>

take your riddles very seriously, although this usually isn’t enough to
dissuade them from killing you.</td>

<td><strong>Narrowly Escaped an Angry Husband.</strong> One escapade in
a post-battle debauch led to a deadly choice: face an angry and armed
city headsman while totally nude, or leap headfirst out a third-story
window. You chose the leap, survived the fall, and haven’t been afraid
of heights since. You treat every fall as if it were 10 feet lower.</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>A: Nonplussed.</strong> You’ve seen it before. Twice. You
have a +4 bonus on saves vs. Fear. If you succeed, allies and hirelings
who can see you have a +2 bonus to their save. Even if you fail the
save, if you were carrying a loaded pistol you can take a shot before
running away.</p>
<p><strong>B: Respect.</strong> You aren’t some bumbling conscript,
you’re a Landsknecht, and people around here are starting to remember
what that means. Peasant militias, wandering thief-catchers and other
assorted low-caste warriors will look to you for guidance. Even the
nobility will stop to listen if you make a fuss, although they might
have you horsewhipped if you say something they don’t like. In addition,
you can issue a challenge to an NPC you aren’t currently fighting. Roll
a d6 to determine their response, which depends on their social class:
Peasant:</p>
<pre><code>1: Disbelief and derision,

2-6: Intimidation and apology.</code></pre>
<p>Soldier:</p>
<pre><code>1: Loud mockery. Expect his friends to try and beat you up.

2-5: They accept. Expect a fistfight or, at best, a choice of two sturdy clubs

6: Intimidation and awkward verbal submission.</code></pre>
<p>Noble (shitty):</p>
<pre><code>1-2: A horsewhipping

3-6: They accept. Name your terms.</code></pre>
<p>Noble (not shitty):</p>
<pre><code>1: Guards! Guards!

2-5: A horsewhipping, followed by a second and more thorough horsewhipping

6: Pistols at dawn.</code></pre>
<p><strong>B: Notches.</strong> Each time you attain a total of 10, 20,
30, and 50 kills with a weapon type (such as 10 kills with a dagger),
you unlock a new ability for that weapon, chosen from the list below.
Keep track of your kills and special abilities on the back of your
character sheet. The GM decides what counts as a kill.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>+1 Damage</p></li>
<li><p>Expanded critical range (+1)</p></li>
<li><p>Special ability (negotiated with GM, one per weapon).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Examples: ability to draw the weapon from any slot, wield a
two-handed weapon in one hand, gain a bonus to use the weapon as a tool,
etc.</p>
<p>For example, a Fighter with 50 flail kills (4 notches) could have +1
damage, a critical range of (18-20), and the ability to stun an opponent
for one round on a critical hit.</p>
<p><strong>C: Savvy Fighter.</strong> You gain +2 on all Combat Maneuver
rolls (page 11).</p>
<p>On a critical success you may also make a free attack against the
target of your combat maneuver or another enemy within range of your
weapon.</p>
<p>You cannot move to use this free attack against a nearby enemy, but
if you have a dagger or hand-axe in a quick-draw item slot you can use
it to make a ranged attack against anyone in range.</p>
<p>You can also come up with your own Combat maneuvers (with GM
approval). A maneuver typically requires a successful attack roll or
Save.</p>
<p><strong>C: Old Friends.</strong> They found you at last; the ones
you’ve been trying to avoid for years. They might owe you a debt, but
they are probably here to collect instead. This is someone who featured
in one of your tall tales; maybe a survivor of a siege, or a hero, or an
angry husband. Or a giant. Or a goat. Or a dead wizard.</p>
<p><strong>D: Riposte.</strong> Once per round when you are struck by an
enemy, make an immediate attack in return.</p>
<p><strong>D: Nose for Trouble.</strong> Your paranoia has saved your
life many times, and if you attend to it closely it will save you many
times more. You always go first in combat. If you are surprised, you
aren’t. If you take someone else by surprise you deal maximum damage
with all attacks on your first turn. You sleep with a loaded gun under
your pillow, and unless you’ve been strip-searched you always have 1d4
knives on your person. If someone demands you hand over your weapons you
can pull the old unloading-an-armory gag and hand over all four — but
you will still be carrying the 1d4.</p>

they’re obviously terrible. Your followers gain +1 morale.</td>

<p><strong>Mechanical Notes on the Merchant</strong> In combat, the
Merchant’s main ability is to attract attention and survive damage. Two
Merchants can work together to keep an enemy distracted, changing who is
the most prominent each round. They start with a dagger, but their main
role will be running around doing stuff while the fight is taking
place.</p>
<p>Out of combat, the Merchant has many tools to assist a group with
their schemes. Forgeries are useful. Being the most prominent person
could allow another PC to sneak by a guard. Being the least prominent
person can allow you - and your sacks of gold, cursed items, etc. - to
be overlooked. Most games don’t have items that are difficult to carry,

<p><strong>B: Duel.</strong> Once per battle, you may lock eyes with an
opponent and <strong>Save vs CH</strong> to goad them into a duel. Other
hostile foes will not engage you until either you or your opponent are
killed or otherwise incapacitated. The effect ends the moment another PC
strikes your target.</p>
<p><strong>C: Almost Got Me.</strong> Once per game session, you can
automatically escape from a situation that is restraining you that you
could plausibly escape from. This includes manacles, pit traps, grapples
and awkward social conversations.</p>
<p><strong>C: Choice Weapon.</strong> Choose a weapon type (dagger,
sword, pistol, rifle, cannon). You gain +1 to damage with that weapon
type.</p>
<p><strong>D: Very Lucky.</strong> You may use your Lucky ability twice
per day. An adjacent ally can use this ability, if you could have
plausibly assisted them.</p>
<p><strong>D: Charmed.</strong> You may ignore a single source of damage
once per game session.</p>
<h2 id="pugilist"><strong>PUGILIST</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> handwraps, simple clothing, a
jug of liquor.</p>
<p><strong>A: Jab, Corner Man, +1 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Hand Wraps, Ground and Pound, +1 HP, +1
To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Tough as Nails, Fundamentals, +1 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Cut Up, What Doesn’t Kill You…, +1 HP, +1
To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Jab.</strong> Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 +STR damage
&amp; count as melee weapons.</p>
<p><strong>A: Corner Man</strong> You have learned how to quickly fix up
cuts and bruises and provide an inspiring pep talk. Each Pugilist
template gives you one use of this ability per day. You can take an
action to help a creature recover 1d6+WIS HP (requires healer’s tools),
give a creature a new attempt to shake off the
<strong>Frightened</strong> condition, or to remove 1
<strong>Fatigue</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>B: Hand Wraps.</strong> You have developed your own secret
technique of wrapping your fists for protection. While you are unarmored
and not wielding a shield, but wearing your hand wraps, add both your
CON and DEX Bonus to AC.</p>
<p><strong>B: Ground and Pound.</strong> Whenever you attack a prone or
grappled enemy, add 1d6 to your damage.</p>
<p><strong>C: Fundamentals.</strong> You gain +2 on all
<strong>unarmed</strong> Combat Maneuver rolls.</p>
<p>On a critical success you may also make a free attack against the
target of your combat maneuver or another enemy within range of your
weapon.</p>
<p>You cannot move to use this free attack against a nearby enemy, but
if you have a dagger or hand-axe in a quick-draw item slot you can use
it to make a ranged attack against anyone in range.</p>
<p>You can also come up with your own Combat maneuvers (with GM
approval). A maneuver typically requires a successful attack roll or
Save.</p>
<p><strong>C: Tough as Nails.</strong> When you are reduced to 0 or less
HP, <strong>Save vs CON</strong> to stay conscious. Track your negative
HP, additional damage can still kill you. Once the combat is over, you
still receive a <strong>Scar</strong> and <strong>Fatigue</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>D: Cut Up.</strong> You know how to celebrate. You have
<strong>advantage</strong> on saves for <strong>Debauchery</strong>
during <strong>Carousing</strong>. After you caroused in a settlement,
you have <strong>advantage</strong> on all social saves with people who
live there.</p>
<p><strong>D: What Doesn’t Kill You…</strong> For every
<strong>Scar</strong> you have earned, you gain a pool of extra attacks
that can be used in the course of a day. All your extra attacks can be
used within the same round.</p>
<h2 id="rider"><strong>RIDER</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> bow, 20 arrows, horse.</p>
<p><strong>A: Mounted Charge, Nomadic Lifestyle, +1 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Milk of the Mare, Quick-Shot, +1 HP, +1
To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Barding, Raider, +1 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Caracole, Padded Hoofs, +1 HP, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Mounted Charge.</strong> If you move at least 25ft on your
mount in a straight line, your melee attacks on that turn have
<strong>Advantage</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A: Nomadic Lifestyle.</strong> You carry your life with you.
Your mount gains 4 additional inventory slots compared to regular
mounts. You also gain 1 extra quick-draw inventory slot while being
mounted.</p>
<p><strong>B: Milk of the Mare.</strong> You can use your horse’s milk
and blood to produce 2 rations per day. Unless the horse is fed or
grazed, this can only be sustained for one week. Your mount gains +5 HP
relative to the regular version of the creature.</p>
<p><strong>B: Quick-Shot.</strong> You can fire two arrows in quick
succession. Your second shot has <strong>disadvantage</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>C: Barding.</strong> You can direct any damage targeted at
your mount on to yourself (except area-of-effect damage). You can also
equip your mount with appropriate barding (+2 AC, 2 inventory slots)</p>
<p><strong>C: Raider.</strong> You are used to traveling large distances
at night and camping without fire. You only need 1
<strong>Watch</strong> for a Good Night’s Rest and no campfire is
required.</p>
<p><strong>D: Caracole.</strong> When you make a <strong>Mounted
Charge</strong>, you also gain advantage on ranged attacks and can
immediately retreat 25ft after your attack. If you combine this with
<strong>Quick-Shot</strong>, your first shot has
<strong>Advantage</strong> and your second shot is a normal.</p>
<p><strong>D: Padded Hoofs</strong>. You can attempt to <strong>Move
silently</strong> while being mounted.</p>
<h2 id="skirmisher"><strong>SKIRMISHER</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> bow, 20 arrows, spear, shield,
50’ of rope. You cannot wear heavy armor.</p>
<p><strong>A: Move Like Water, Tricky, +1 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Evasion, Opportunist, +1 HP, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Acrobatics, Lucky, +1 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Great Escape, Reflect, Extra Attack, +1 HP, +1
To-Hit</strong></p>
<p>Gain +1HP and +1 to Move Silently &amp; Unseen for each Skirmisher
template that you possess.</p>
<p><strong>A: Move Like Water.</strong> While unarmored, add both your
<strong>CHA</strong> and your <strong>DEX bonus</strong> to AC.</p>
<p><strong>A: Tricky.</strong> You gain +2 on all Combat Maneuver rolls
(page 11).</p>
<p>On a critical hit you may also make a free attack against the target
of your combat maneuver or another enemy within range of your
weapon.</p>
<p>If you did not move this round, or split movement, you may make a
full move to engage a second target. Reducing them to 0HP activates this
ability again.</p>
<p>You may engage 1 foe with this ability for each Skirmisher templates
that you possess.</p>
<p><strong>B: Evasion.</strong> You have advantage on <strong>DEX
saves</strong> vs attacks, as long as you can see the attack coming. If
a success would 1⁄2 the damage, you instead take no damage.</p>
<p>Treat fall distance as half for determining damage.</p>
<p><strong>B: Opportunist.</strong> Whenever you have a situational
bonus (surprise, elevation, benefit from a <strong>combat
maneuver</strong>, etc.) your attacks deal an additional +1d6
damage.</p>
<p><strong>C: Acrobatics.</strong> You can jump twice as far as normal
(<strong>STR+10</strong> x2). If there is a stable wall, you can instead
wall-run four times as far (<strong>STR+10</strong> x4).</p>
<p><strong>C: Lucky.</strong> Once per encounter you can re-roll a
failed attack or Save. Use the new result.</p>
<p><strong>D: Great Escape.</strong> Once per day you can escape from
something that is restraining you and that can plausibly be escaped
from.</p>
<p>This includes grapples, lynchings, and awkward situations, but not
sealed coffins.</p>
<p><strong>D: Reflect.</strong> Once per encounter you can reduce the
damage of a physical ranged attack by 1d6, +1 for each Skirmisher
template that you possess. No roll is necessary.</p>
<p>If this reduces the damage to 0, a target of your choosing is hit by
the attack instead.</p>

<p><strong>NOTES ON THE SKIRMISHER</strong> Where a Fighter is a
straightforward professional, the Skirmisher is a flashy showboater.
Speed is your best armor and Evasion, Lucky, and Reflect represent
this.</p>
<p>Tricky and Opportunist encourage creative use of <strong>combat
maneuvers</strong> and setting up combo attacks with party members.</p>
<p>It still has all the eventually fatal drawbacks of the core
class.</p>
<p>The <strong>Skirmisher</strong> is akin to a Mad Martigan, Xena:
Warrior Princess, Brad Pitt’s Achilles, or Oberyn Martell.</p>
<h2 id="thief"><strong>THIEF</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment</strong>: light armor, files, lock- picks,

<p><strong>C: Pick 1 Thief Ability, Roll 1 Thief Ability, +1

<p><strong>D: Pick 1 Thief Ability Roll 1 Thief Ability</strong></p>
<p>You have advantage on <strong>DEX saves</strong> made to move
silently and unseen, but only when you are alone or working with other
Thieves.</p>
<p><strong>A: Always Prepared.</strong> In town, you may spend 20 gold
pieces (or items of equivalent value) to buy an Unlabelled Package. When
the package is unwrapped in play, you declare what it contains, as long
as the contents comprise the appropriate number of Item Slots and are
available in town. Small items that can be bundled together (ex. 3 oil
flasks) will be of a quantity sufficient to fill the Item Slot. You can
have up to two Unlabelled Packages at a time.</p>
<p><strong>A: Rumors.</strong> When entering a steading for the first
time, or returning from an adventure, you may learn one rumor
automatically without making a <strong>Save vs Charisma</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A: Wall Crawler</strong>. Wall Crawler is a permission slip
to get almost anywhere you like. You climb just as well without climbing
gear as with it. If a climb is possible using gear, you don’t need to
roll, even if you’re free-climbing. If a climb would be impossible you
can make a skill check to attempt it anyway.</p>

<p><strong>NOTES ON THE THIEF</strong> Thieves are the ultimate
“Adventurer” class. They are all about options in the form of tools,
equipment, and skills. I think they are one of the best classes for new
players. Thieves should be as simple as possible; encourage shenanigans;
and have room for variation in case multiple new players pick this
class.</p>
<p>The Thief abilities are invented or collected from various other
thieves and thief-like classes. Every thief gets a unique combination of
them, depending on what they pick and what they roll.</p>
<h2 id="vagabond"><strong>VAGABOND</strong></h2>
<p>Knows Hobo signs, can get to places unnoticed, Hobo song, some thief
skills, King of Beggars</p>

<p><strong>C: Roll 1 Thief Ability, Hobo Song, +1HP, +1

<p><strong>D: Roll 1 Thief Ability, King of Beggars, +1HP</strong></p>
<p>You have advantage on <strong>DEX saves</strong> made to move
silently and unseen, but only when you are alone or working with other
Thieves.</p>
<p><strong>A: Hobo Signs.</strong> When entering a steading for the
first time, or returning from an adventure, you may learn one rumor
automatically without making a <strong>Save vs Charisma</strong> or
learn another useful piece of information about the location.</p>
<p><strong>A: Roughin’ It.</strong> Vagabonds can easily find places to
rest. They recover 2 <strong>Fatigue</strong> with a <strong>Good
Night’s Rest</strong>, even under bad weather conditions.</p>
<p><strong>B: Seasoned Traveler.</strong> During
<strong>Exploration</strong>, you decrease the party’s chances of
getting lostby 1-6 and you increase the party’s chances of finding
interesting places by 1-6.</p>
<p><strong>C: Hobo Song.</strong> You can know inspiring Hobo songs and
tall tales. During a <strong>lunch</strong>, you can can entertain the
party. Each member recovers 1 level of <strong>Fatigue</strong>. This
benefit can only be received once per day.</p>
<p><strong>D: King of Beggars.</strong> You can call on the help of
local beggars and street urchins. Gain 1d12 temporary hirelings that

<p>You gain +1 Magic Die (MD) and +1 Signature Spell for each Wizard
template you possess, to a maximum of 4 each (templates &amp; MD).</p>
<p>When you first gain a Wizard template, you cannot multiclass into
other spellcasting classes, though you may gain templates from other
Adventurer or otherwise magical classes.</p>
<p>When you select Template A, roll 1d6 gain the spell listed as a
<strong>Signature Spell</strong>. You can repeat this process for each
<strong>Int</strong> ability bonus you have (but you can also reserve
this for spells you find while adventuring). When you receive Template
B, roll 1d8. Template C, roll 1d10. If a duplicate spell is rolled,
select the spell above or below it on the list.</p>
<p>As you level, you will gain spells from your class’s spell list. You
still can learn and cast spells from outside your school.</p>
<p>All of your MD return if you get a <strong>Good Night’s
Rest</strong>. If you didn’t sleep well or your rest was disrupted by a
hazard or combat, make a <strong>WIS save</strong> for each MD to have
them return to your pool anyway.</p>

spells. See <strong>Magic and Spells</strong> for details on how
spellcasting works. The wizard’s spellcasting ability is

coin to roll along the ground or turn the pages of a book.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>B: Book Casting.</strong> You can cast spells from a
spellbook or scroll without making them a <strong>Signature
Spell</strong>. See <strong>Magic and Spells</strong> for details on how
book casting works.</p>
<p><strong>B: Arcane Recovery.</strong> During <strong>Lunch</strong>
you can attempt to recover one lost MD. <strong>Save vs WIS</strong> to
return a lost MD to your pool.</p>
<p><strong>C: Friendly Spell.</strong> Apply a random effect from the
<strong>Friendly Spell Mutation</strong> to one of your
<strong>Signature Spells</strong>.</p>
<p>Mutating other spells you already know is possible with 4 templates
from the wizard class and access to a wizard’s sanctum. Use
<strong>spell research</strong> on the <strong>Magic Crafting</strong>
table to determine the time and cost of additional mutations.</p>
<p>The time and cost of <strong>spell research</strong> doubles,
triples, etc. for each additional mutation beyond the first that a
wizard attempts to apply to a spell.</p>
<p><strong>C: Flame Proof.</strong> You can cast spells from a scroll
without destroying the scroll. See <strong>Magic and Spells</strong> for
more details.</p>
<p><strong>D: Iron Will.</strong> You can control the results of your
spellcasting through your iron will. <strong>Save vs WIS</strong> to
change the result of one of your rolled MD by one point. This can be
used to increase the effect of your spell or avoid a
<strong>Mishap</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>D: Master of Magic.</strong> Learn any 5 spells from your
spell list.</p>
<p>With the proper materials, time, and a wizard’s sanctum you can now
create magic items.</p>
<p><strong>D: Spell Creation.</strong> Invent a new spell, or adapt one
from the <strong>D100 Spells</strong> table (see <strong>MAGIC AND
SPELLS</strong>). Consider this spell an ongoing project between you and
the Referee. You may tweak and control it’s effects through play.</p>
<p>The process takes 1 month of uninterrupted work. When completed, make
a <strong>Save vs INT</strong> with a -5 modifier or suffer
<strong>1d3</strong> simultaneous <strong>Mishaps</strong>.</p>
<p>Gain a +1 bonus to your save for:</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> every 150 gp spent on reagents, inks, magical
artifacts, incense, etc.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> each ritual preparation described to the Referee
(max bonus of +2).</p>
<p><strong>c)</strong> each 100 sq. ft. of Wizard’s Sanctum you have to
work with.[^*] [^]* Make your <strong>save</strong> with
<strong>disadvantage</strong> if attempting to create a new spell
without access to a proper sanctum.</p>
<p><strong>WIZARD’S SANCTUM</strong></p>
<p>A Wizard’s Sanctum is part laboratory, part library, and vital in the
conduct of wizardly business -creating magic scrolls, weaving magic
robes, conducting arcane research, studying the heavens, and scrying on
their rivals.</p>
<p>The sanctums of wizard-artificers, where they create small arcanum,
are more pragmatic, resembling a hybrid watchmaker/blacksmith’s
workshop.</p>
<p>In order to create the most modest magic item (ex: a scroll with 1
spell and 1MD) a sanctum of 100 sq. ft. worth 750 gp is required. To
create a new spellbook (10 spells) requires 1,000 sq. ft. worth 7,500
gp.</p>
<p>A scribe must be hired full-time to maintain the sanctum. Without a
scribe the sanctum loses 1d6 x100 gp per month in value due to lost or
destroyed resources.</p>
<p>A scribe costs 50 gp per month and requires an additional 100 sq. ft.
of living space.</p>
<p>To conduct research or create a magic item the wizard makes an
<strong>INT Save</strong>. If successful the sanctum loses 1d6x100 gp
due to supplies used. If failed, wasted supplies and accidents reduce
the value of the sanctum by 2d6 x100 gp.</p>
<p>With a critical success the sanctum loses no resources. On a critical
failure a terrible mishap consumes 4d6 x100 gp of the sanctum’s value,
the project being worked on is destroyed, and the wizard suffers
<strong>1d3</strong> simultaneous <strong>Mishaps</strong> from their
class table.</p>
<p>These costs are in addition to those listed on the <strong>Magic
Crafting Table</strong>. Attempting any of the above without a proper
sanctum is not impossible, but a wizard triples their costs, the time
required, and make all <strong>INT Saves</strong> with disadvantage.</p>
<p>The time and cost reflect the fickle nature of working with sentient
spells, and the special materials needed to create the binding wards
necessary to contain them. A wizard can reduce the time (and thus cost)
by one day/ week for every <strong>+2 Bonus</strong> in
<strong>Intelligence</strong> they possess. Crafting takes a minimum of
1 day or week to complete.</p>
<p>Sanctums discovered in dungeon ruins or taken by force, and somehow
transported, add 1d100% of their value to that of the looter’s sanctum
due to duplication, difference in methods between wizards, etc.</p>

<p><strong>CLASSIC WIZARD SPELL LIST</strong> Typical Spell Format:</p>
<p>Name.</p>
<p><em>R: (range), T: (# of targets), D: (duration)</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Lock.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50ft, T: [dice] creatures or objects, D: 1 Turn</em></p>
<p>Non-living object closes and becomes locked. If the object is a door,
chest, or similar object, it will slam shut, dealing [sum] damage to any
creature passing through it and then trapping them.</p>
<p>This spell works on things that aren’t technically portals (lock a
sword in its scabbard, etc.). Requires Str 10+[dice]x4 to open.
Alternatively, this spell can be cast on a creature’s orifice. The
creature gets a Save to resist, and another Save at the end of each of
its turns.</p>
<p><strong>2. Knock.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50ft, T: [dice] objects, D: 0</em></p>
<p>Object is opened. Doors are flung wide, locks are broken, shackles
are bent open, belts come undone. Treat this as a Strength check made
with Str 10 + [dice]x4. If target is an armored creature, Save or armor
falls off. If target is an unarmored creature, Save or vomit for 1d4
rounds.</p>
<p><strong>3. Grease.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50ft, T: object, surface, D: [dice]x2 rounds</em></p>
<p>Can be cast directly on a creature or a 10’ x 10’ x [dice] surface.
All creatures affected must Save vs Dex or drop held objects, or, if
moving, drop prone.</p>
<p><strong>4. Force Field.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 10ft, T: plane or sphere, D: concentration up to [dice]
Turns</em></p>
<p>Creates a shimmering force field, 10‘x10’, centered up to 10’ away.
Alternatively, create a sphere centered on the caster 5’ in diameter
(large enough for the caster and +1 person). The force field has [sum]
HP. All attacks against it hit.</p>
<p><strong>5. Levitate.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50ft, T: creature object, D: concentration</em></p>
<p>You will an object to raise, lower, or hover. You cannot move the
object horizontally, and you cannot move it more than 10’ per turn.
Maximum weight is [dice]x500 lbs. Lasts as long as you concentrate, but
you take 1d6 psychic damage per round after [dice]x3 rounds.</p>
<p><strong>6. Magic Missile.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 200ft, T: up to [dice]creatures, D: 0</em></p>
<p>Target takes [sum] + [dice] damage, no Save. As an Orthodox Wizard,
your spell is unique to you and can be any shape, color, and pattern
your describe.</p>
<p><strong>7. Feather Fall.</strong></p>
<p><strong>R: 10ft, T: [dice] creatures or objects, D: 0</strong></p>
<p>If you would take fall damage, you can cast this spell as a reaction
to negate it. You float gently to the ground (possibly alarmingly
late).</p>
<p><strong>8. Sleep.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50ft, T: [sum] HD of creatures D: 1 Turn / permanent</em></p>
<p>Target falls into a magical slumber, and can’t be awoken by anything
less vigorous than a slap. Save negates. Non-alert, unaware targets do
not get a Save. If [sum] is at least 4 times the creature’s HD, the
duration becomes permanent (until slapped) and creature no longer needs
to eat or drink while sleeping.</p>
<p>If you also invested 3 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration
becomes permanent, and you can set the only condition that will cause
the creature to awake (the sunrise before the apocalypse, true love’s
kiss, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>9. Light.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: touch, T: object or creature, D: [dice]x2 hours.</em></p>
<p>Object illuminates as a torch, with a radius of 20’+[dice]x10’. You
can choose the color of the light.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can make an Attack roll against a sighted
creature. If you succeed, the creature is blinded for [sum] rounds. If
[sum] is greater than 12, the creature is permanently blinded.</p>
<p>If you invest 4 [dice] or more this light has all the qualities of
natural sunlight. Alternatively, if you invest 4 [dice] or more the
light can be purest octarine, although it will only last for 1 round.
Octarine light is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>10. Wizard Vision.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: touch, T: sighted creature, D: 1 Turn / permanent</em></p>
<p>If you invest one [die]: Target can see invisible things. Target can
see through illusions. Non- magical disguises are not penetrated.</p>
<p>If you invest two or more [dice]: This can only be cast on yourself.
As above, except you can also see through magical darkness, and see the
true forms of shapeshifters.</p>
<p>There are also some permanent effects: (a) You can forever see
invisible things as a slight warping or lensing of light. You know
“there’s something over there” and what size it roughly is, but nothing
else. (b) You can tell if someone else is a spellcaster by looking them
in the eyes.</p>
<p>The price for this gift is your mind. You suffer a permanent loss of
1d3 Wisdom (as you reject the true nature of Creation and go slightly
mad) or 1d3 Charisma (as you accept the true nature of Creation and
alienate yourself from your peers).</p>
<p><strong>EMBLEM SPELLS</strong></p>
<p><strong>11. Prismatic Ray.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 200ft, T: [dice] creatures or objects, D: 0</em></p>
<p>Target suffers a different effect depending on which color strikes
the target. <strong>Roll 1d10</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>12. Fireball.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 100’, T: 20’ radius, D:0</em></p>
<p>Does [sum] + [dice] fire damage to all creatures and objects in a
20ft radius. Creatures keep burning for 1d6 fire damage each round until
extinguished.</p>

<p>This last doom can be undone by eating the heart of a powerful

entirely new spells that have never been cast by anyone else. Good luck
finding or inventing those!</p>
<p><strong>NOTES ON THE ORTHODOX WIZARD</strong></p>
<p>This is the iconic wizard of fantasy gaming and literature. Gandalf.
Merlin. Alan Moore. This school has access to some very powerful
problem-solving tools. You can’t go very wrong with the classic wizard
spell set.</p>
<h2 id="elementalist"><strong>ELEMENTALIST</strong></h2>
<p>Elementalist Wizards speak to and rely on elemental spirits. They are
a wild bunch, disreputable and windblown. In rural areas, they are
beloved as rain-bringers and flood- calmers, but they are also run out
of town or hung following forest fires and earthquakes. This is not
always ignorant superstition. Attracting the attention of powerful
spirits is very dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> Spellbook, ink, quill. You can
wear light armor but would probably prefer magic robes?</p>
<p><strong>A: +1 MD, +1 Signature Spell (1d6), Spellcasting,
Cantrips</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: +1 MD, +1 Signature Spell (1d8), Book Casting, Elemental
Recovery, Elemental Resistance</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: +1 MD, +1 Signature Spell (1d10), Elemental
Vision</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: +1 MD, Master of Magic, Spell Creation, Iron
Will</strong></p>
<p>You gain +1 Magic Die (MD) and +1 Signature Spell for each
Elementalist template you possess, to a maximum of 4 each (templates
&amp; MD).</p>
<p>When you first gain a Elementalist template, you cannot multiclass
into other spellcasting classes, though you may gain templates from
other Adventurer or otherwise magical classes.</p>
<p>When you select Template A, roll 1d6 gain the spell listed as a
<strong>Signature Spell</strong>. You can repeat this process for each
<strong>Int</strong> ability bonus you have (but you can also reserve
this for spells you find while adventuring). When you receive Template
B, roll 1d8. Template C, roll 1d10. If a duplicate spell is rolled,
select the spell above or below it on the list.</p>
<p>As you level, you will gain spells from your class’s spell list. You
still can learn and cast spells from outside your school.</p>
<p>All of your MD return if you get a <strong>Good Night’s
Rest</strong>. If you didn’t sleep well or your rest was disrupted by a
hazard or combat, make a <strong>WIS save</strong> for each MD to have
them return to your pool anyway.</p>
<p><strong>A: Spellcasting.</strong> You gain the ability to cast
spells. See <strong>Magic and Spells</strong> for details on how
spellcasting works. The Elementalist’s spellcasting ability is
<strong>INT</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Cannot cast fire spells if wet. Cannot
cast water or ice spells if dehydrated. Cannot cast earth or acid spells
if you are not touching the ground. Cannot cast air or lightning spells
if you do not have line of sight to the sky..</p>
<p><strong>A: Cantrips</strong> You have mastered minor magics:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You can sense the potency and disposition of any nearby elemental
spirits.</p></li>
<li><p>Summon a flame the size of a candle’s by snapping your fingers.
Cannot be used to deal damage. Will light a lantern, torch,
etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Meditate for 1 hour to gain a new Save against any poison or
damaging effect.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>B: Elemental Resistance.</strong> +3 to Save or AC vs
Elemental damage. No bonus against non-damaging effects.</p>
<p><strong>B: Elemental Recovery.</strong> During <strong>Lunch</strong>
you can attempt to recover one lost MD. <strong>Save vs WIS</strong> to
return a lost MD to your pool.</p>
<p><strong>B: Book Casting.</strong> You can cast spells from a
spellbook or scroll without making them a <strong>Signature
Spell</strong>. See <strong>Magic and Spells</strong> for details on how
book casting works.</p>
<p><strong>C: Elemental Vision.</strong> Your training allows you to
anthropomorphize elemental spirits. The ground appears to be made of
interlinked stone bodies. A campfire is a jolly spirit devouring logs.
Clouds appear as fat naked people rolling through the sky. You can speak
to the spirits - you always could, anyone can - but when you are attuned
like this, they are more inclined to listen. They won’t obey you, and
they may be hostile, but they may also offer advice, tell tales, demand
offerings, or simply ignore you.</p>
<p><strong>D: Master of Magic.</strong> Learn any 5 spells from your
spell list.</p>
<p>With the proper materials, time, and a wizard’s sanctum you can now
create magic items.</p>
<p><strong>D: Iron Will.</strong> You can control the results of your
spellcasting through your iron will. <strong>Save vs WIS</strong> to
change the result of one of your rolled MD by one point. This can be
used to increase the effect of your spell or avoid a
<strong>Mishap</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>D: Spell Creation.</strong> See Wizard class description for
details.</p>
<p><strong>ELEMENTALIST SPELL LIST</strong> For spells with [element]
listed, you can choose the element. If you’d generate a duplicate of a
spell with the [element] tag as you gain Wizard templates, you may
either reroll the spell, or choose a different element. There’s no rule
that says you have to be consistent in your element choices, but it will
probably happen naturally.</p>
<p>Typical Spell Format:</p>
<p><strong>Name.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: (range), T: (# of targets), D: (duration)</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Circle of Frost.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: self T: [dice]x10’ radius D: 3 rounds</em></p>
<p>All creatures in area take 1d4 damage, Save vs DEX for half.
Everything that fails its Save is frozen to whatever surface they were
touching. Boots are frozen to the ground, keys are frozen in their
locks. Creatures are usually immobilized from the boots down unless they
were playing in a fountain or something. Attempting to break loose is a
free action that can be attempted once per round, and requires a
successful opposed Strength test. The ice has a Strength of 10 +
[dice]x2.</p>
<p><strong>2. Control [Element]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Control Air.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: a gust of wind D: concentration</em></p>
<p>Control a gust of wind within 50’. At one [die], use wind to (a)
clear away fog or gas, (b) extinguish a fire no larger than a torch, (c)
blow all the papers off a desk, (d) with concentration, provide enough
of a breeze to power a tiny sailboat. Each [dice] you invest increases
the effects.</p>
<p>**Control Earth.*8</p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: a bucket’s worth of earth D: concentration</em></p>
<p>Control a small amount of earth within 50’. At one [die]: (a)
excavate a bucket’s worth of dirt, (b) smooth and fill the same amount,
(c) causing the earth to quickly swallow a small item, or quickly
swallow a non-resisting person, chest, or signpost, (d) exhume something
at the same rate, (e) knock over some hobo’s shack with a tiny tremor.
Each [dice] you invest increases the effects.</p>
<p><strong>Control Fire.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: a torch’s worth of fire D: concentration</em></p>
<p>Control a small fire within 50’ At one [die]: (a) cause a fire to
double in size, power, and brightness, (b) create a huge amount of
smoke, (c) extinguish a fire no larger than a torch, (d) have a small
ember (0 damage) jump 1’ off the fire, (e) ignite something that is
meant to be burnt, such as a match, cigarette, or fuse, (f) heat up a
cup of tea to a pleasant temperature. Each [dice] you invest increases
the effects.</p>
<p><strong>Control Rain.</strong> <em>R: 1000’ T: self D: [dice]
hours</em></p>
<p>If it’s raining, you can make it not rain for 1000’ around you. If
there’s not a cloud in the sky, this spell has no effect. If it’s
cloudy, you can make it rain for 1000’ around you. Most days have a 40%
chance of being cloudy. Cannot be cast indoors.</p>
<p><strong>Control Water.</strong> <em>R: 50’ T: a bucket’s worth of
water D: concentration</em></p>
<p>Control a small amount of water within 50’. At one [die]: (a) propel
a small boat, (b) carry a small item through the water, (c) allow
someone to swim at 2x speed, (d) force someone to swim at half speed,
(e) splash something no more than 5’ away, (f) dry something that is
wet, (g) freeze a small amount of water, (h) cool a hot cup of tea. Each
[dice] you invest increases the effects. Good luck adjudicating these,
but you get the idea. With 4 [dice] you should be able to sink a ship or
turn back a river. Something equivalent to a full-blast fireball. Water
spirits carry means of purifying corruption, and Elementalists know
their secret ways.</p>
<p><strong>3. Dissolve.</strong> <em>R: 50’ T: object or creature D:
concentration</em></p>
<p>Target you stare at takes 1d4 acid damage per round and begins to
dissolve. Save vs Con for half damage. Can bore holes in walls, but it
only makes a hole 1’ and creates a lot of acidic sludge on the floor.
[dice]”/10 minutes through stone, [dice]”/minute through wood, cannot
affect metal. Heals slimes and oozes for 1d4/round.</p>
<p>This is a strange little spell. 1d4 damage per round with a chance to
save for half isn’t much, but it’s the duration that makes it really
dangerous. It’s a little tickle of damage but it’s continuous, and at
low levels, that’s nothing to sneeze at. You can also melt locks,
hinges, tripwires, or illusions with it.</p>
<p><strong>4. [Element] Breath.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: [dice]x20‘ cone T: area D: 0</em></p>
<p>Does [sum] damage to anything in the cone. Save vs CON for half
damage. Wind or Water breath extinguishes all fires smaller than a big
bonfire. Fire breath sets very flammable things on fire. Acid breath
bleaches the color from objects and irritates the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>5. Stoneskin.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: touch T: creature D: [dice] Turns</em></p>
<p>Reduce all physical damage the target takes by 5 per[dice] invested.
The target cannot swim, jump, or run. Dispel at will.</p>
<p><strong>6. Anklecrusher.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: [dice]x2 objects or creatures D: 0</em></p>
<p>Target creature or object is grabbed by the ground itself. Target
takes 1d6 damage and is immobilized. Save vs DEX to negate, prone
creatures automatically fail. Target is immobilized. STR Save to break
free. The difficulty of the Save depends on what the ground is made of:
Dirt 8, Clay 12, Limestone 16, Basalt 18. This spell has no effect on
things that aren’t touching the ground.</p>
<p><strong>7. Protection from [Element]</strong></p>
<p><em>R: touch T: [dice]x[dice] targets D: 10 minutes / 8
hours</em></p>
<p>Reduce all damage of the chosen type by 4 for the next 10
minutes.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the spell protects its targets from the negative
effects of the element (desert heat, arctic chill) for the next 8
hours.</p>
<p><strong>8. Ignite.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: object or creature D: 0</em></p>
<p>Target object or object takes [sum] damage and catches on fire. WIS
Save negates.</p>
<p><strong>9. Breathe [Element]</strong></p>
<p><em>R: touch T: [dice] creatures D: 2 hr</em></p>
<p>Target can breath in the chosen element, in addition to their normal
modes of respiration. Clearing your lungs before the spell expires is
mandatory. Does not grant you protection from that element, just from
drowning in it.</p>
<p><strong>10. Wind Scythe.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: object or creature D: 0</em></p>
<p>Apply a melee attack from a slashing weapon in your hand to a target
within 50’. If you are unarmed, counts as a dagger (1d6). Gain +2 to
Attack and deal +[sum] damage.</p>
<p><strong>EMBLEM SPELLS</strong></p>
<p><strong>11. Wall of [Element]</strong></p>
<p>(I’m not sure what a “Wall of Acid” or “Wall of Ice” would look like,
precisely, but I’m pretty sure that I could use 3 walls listed below to
figure them out in a hurry.)</p>
<p><strong>Wall of Earth.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 20’ T: wall D: permanent</em></p>
<p>You rearrange dirt to form a 10’ by 10’ panel per [dice]. You can
mold the wall, similar to cutting holes and notches in a sheet of paper.
The wall has AC10 and [dice]x5 HD. If it is horizontal, the wall must be
anchored on at least 2 sides.</p>
<p><strong>Wall of Fire.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 20’ T: wall D: 1 minute</em></p>
<p>You summon fire to form a 10’ by 10’ panel per [dice]. You can mold
the wall, similar to cutting holes and notches in a sheet of paper. The
wall does not block line of sight. It deals 1d6 fire damage to anything
that passes through it. Any creature passing through the wall must Save
vs DEX or be set on fire (1d8 damage for 1d6 rounds).</p>
<p><strong>Wall of Wind.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 20’ T: wall D: 1 minute</em></p>
<p>You summon wind to form a 10’ by 10’ panel per [dice]. You can mold
the wall, similar to cutting holes and notches in a sheet of paper. The
wall does not block line of sight. Powerful winds will knock small
projectiles out of the air and prevent vermin (anything smaller than a
rat) from crossing. Ranged attacks that pass through the wall are
[dice]x(-3) to-hit.</p>
<p>The walls are… walls. Area control, damage, problem solving, river
diverting, ship- tormenting walls.</p>
<p><strong>12. Shocking Grasp.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 0 T: self D: 10 min</em></p>
<p>You enchant your hand so that it discharges [sum]+[dice]x2 damage
worth of lightning into the next thing you touch. Touching an unwilling
opponent requires an Attack roll against their unarmored armor class
(AC10+DEX). You cannot wear any metal on the hand you enchant. If you
deal more than 12 damage, you and your target must both Save vs STR or
be flung apart, knocked prone, and deafened for 1d6 rounds.</p>
<p><strong>ELEMENTALIST MISHAPS</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours</p></li>
<li><p>Take 1d6 damage</p></li>
<li><p>Random mutation (page 86) for 1d6 rounds, then Save vs
Constitution or it’s permanent.</p></li>
<li><p>By element:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>soaked, or dehydrated</p></li>
<li><p>flung upwards 1d3x10’, 1d6 fall damage per 10’</p></li>
<li><p>Buried and immobilized. STR Save to free yourself</p></li>
<li><p>burned for 1d8 damage</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>Deafened for 1d6 rounds</p></li>
<li><p>Wild elemental spirits flee your body for 1d6 rounds. Everyone
within line of sight must Save vs WIS each round or be stunned.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>DOOM OF THE ELEMENTALIST</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Take sufficient elemental damage to reduce you to zero HP.
Receive a Scar.</p></li>
<li><p>Each time you cast an Elemental spell, Save vs WIS or the spell
flies out of control. If it likes you, the effects might not be too
bad.</p></li>
<li><p>The elements turn against you. Expect 1d4+4 powerful spirits to
arrive shortly. In the meantime, fire chases you, stones seek to crush
you, the earth trembles, and lightning bolts plunge from the
sky.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This doom can be avoided by journeying to a powerful elemental shrine
and pledging yourself to the spirit within, or by visiting pure vacuum
or the deepest shadow.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid the wrath of a powerful elemental, find a more
powerful elemental to protect you (and, by extension, your friends).
Alternatively, visit a place beyond the elements. Shadow and vacuum can
cut the ties that let elementals identify you.</p>
<h2 id="illusionist"><strong>ILLUSIONIST</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> Spellbook, ink,
quill,rainbow-colored gloves or ridiculously large rainbow-colored
scarf. You can wear light armor but would probably prefer magic
robes?</p>
<p><strong>A: +1 MD, +1 Signature Spell (1d6), Spellcasting,
Cantrips</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: +1 MD, +1 Signature Spell (1d8), Book Casting, Illusory
Recovery, Lasting Illusions</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: +1 MD, +1 Signature Spell (1d10), Malleable
Illusions</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: +1 MD, Master of Magic, Spell Creation, Iron
Will</strong></p>
<p>You gain +1 Magic Die (MD) and +1 Signature Spell for each
Illusionist template you possess, to a maximum of 4 each (templates
&amp; MD).</p>
<p>When you first gain an Illusionist template, you cannot multiclass
into other spellcasting classes, though you may gain templates from
other Adventurer or otherwise magical classes.</p>
<p>When you select Template A, roll 1d6 gain the spell listed as a
<strong>Signature Spell</strong>. You can repeat this process for each
<strong>Int</strong> ability bonus you have (but you can also reserve
this for spells you find while adventuring). When you receive Template
B, roll 1d8. Template C, roll 1d10. If a duplicate spell is rolled,
select the spell above or below it on the list.</p>
<p>As you level, you will gain spells from your class’s spell list. You
still can learn and cast spells from outside your school.</p>
<p>All of your MD return if you get a <strong>Good Night’s
Rest</strong>. If you didn’t sleep well or your rest was disrupted by a
hazard or combat, make a <strong>WIS save</strong> for each MD to have
them return to your pool anyway.</p>
<p><strong>A: Spellcasting.</strong> You gain the ability to cast
spells. See <strong>Magic and Spells</strong> for details on how
spellcasting works. The Illusionist’s spellcasting ability is
<strong>INT</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You cannot cast spells unless you can see
all 7 primary colors (via your gloves or scarf if nothing else is
available). Your magic supplies the 8th: octarine.</p>
<p>Ah. Right. Pitch darkness is out. Being blind is out. A thick fog is
going to make things interesting. Losing your gloves or getting blood
all over them is going to be a disaster. Octarine, the Color of Magic,
is stolen from the Discworld series.</p>
<p><strong>A: Cantrips</strong> You have mastered minor magics:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Create a shower of illusory sparks or a puff of illusory smoke
from your hands.</p></li>
<li><p>Touch another caster’s illusion and make and Opposed Intelligence
check. If you succeed, you gain control of the illusion.</p></li>
<li><p>You always know the position of the sun in the sky.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>B: Lasting Illusions.</strong> Your illusion spells have a
duration of “Concentration + 1 minute”. The duration increase is very,
very nice. Other people can cast illusions, but you are an
Illusionist.</p>
<p><strong>B: Book Casting.</strong> You can cast spells from a
spellbook or scroll without making them a <strong>Signature
Spell</strong>. See <strong>Magic and Spells</strong> for details on how
book casting works.</p>
<p><strong>B: Illusory Recovery.</strong> During <strong>Lunch</strong>
you can attempt to recover one lost MD. <strong>Save vs WIS</strong> to
return a lost MD to your pool.</p>
<p><strong>C: Lasting Illusions.</strong> If you control an illusion and
it is within line of sight, you can change it’s nature or form once per
round. You could use illusion to create a goblin and then, when pursued,
transform it into a tiger. Illusions will still work outside of your
line of sight, and will exhibit reasonably correct behaviors. A
guard-illusion will march if told to march. A fire-illusion will burn
(but not spread). The spells that create illusions are about as
intelligent as a dog.</p>
<p><strong>D: Master of Magic.</strong> Learn any 5 spells from your
spell list.</p>
<p>With the proper materials, time, and a wizard’s sanctum you can now
create magic items.</p>
<p><strong>D: Spell Creation.</strong> See Wizard class description for
details.</p>
<p><strong>D: Iron Will.</strong> You can control the results of your
spellcasting through your iron will. <strong>Save vs WIS</strong> to
change the result of one of your rolled MD by one point. This can be
used to increase the effect of your spell or avoid a
<strong>Mishap</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>ILLUSIONIST SPELL LIST</strong></p>
<p>Typical Spell Format:</p>
<p><strong>Name.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: (range), T: (# of targets), D: (duration)</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Illusion</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: [dice]x5’ diameter D: concentration / concentration+1
minute</em></p>
<p>You create an illusion of whatever object or creature you want. It
can move at your will, but cannot make any sound or smell. Illusions can
only add, not subtract. They can cover up a hole, but not create the
illusion of a hole. This spell is the default “make an illusory object”
spell. Note the area restriction. At 1 dice you can’t create a 6’ tall
illusory human. The spell is deliberately vague.</p>
<p><strong>2. Disguise</strong></p>
<p><em>R: touch T: object D: [dice] hours / concentration+1
minute</em></p>
<p>You cloak the object in illusion, making it appear as another object
of the same type. An apple could be disguised as any other type of
fruit; a table could be disguised as any other type of furniture. A
humanoid can be disguised as any other humanoid of comparable size. This
only extends to the visual properties of the object. The maximum size of
the object depends on how many dice are invested in the spell: 1 [dice]:
human- sized, 2 [dice]: ogre- or wagon-sized, 3 [dice]: dragon- or
tavern-sized, [dice]: ship- or bridge-sized.</p>
<p>These disguises are perfect, visually. You can’t “see through them”,
but you can go “Hey, wait a minute, that hill is making a lot of smoke.”
“Hey, hold on, I’m pretty sure the King had a limp and didn’t speak with
an accent.”</p>
<p><strong>3. Prismatic Ray</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 200’ T: [dice] creatures or objects D: 0</em></p>
<p>Target suffers a different effect depending on which color strikes
the target. Roll a d10: 1. Red. Target takes [sum] fire damage, Save for
half. 2. Orange. Target takes [sum] bludgeoning damage and is knocked
prone. Save negates. 3. Yellow. Target takes [sum] lightning damage,
Save for half. 4. Green. Target takes [sum] acid damage, Save for half.
5. Blue. Target takes [sum] ice damage, Save for half. 6. Purple. Target
takes [sum] necrotic damage and is blinded for [sum] rounds. Save
negates. 7, 8, 9. Struck twice. Roll a d6 twice. Add effects; make one
save. 10. Struck thrice. Roll a d6 three times.</p>
<p><strong>4. Mirror Image</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 0 T: self D: 10 minutes / concentration+1 minute</em></p>
<p>You create 1d4+[dice] illusory images of yourself, which move as you
move and always stay within 5’ of you. They are constantly stepping
through each other, so that it is impossible to tell which is which.
When an enemy attacks you, roll to see if they hit you or an image. An
image vanishes as soon as it suffers a solid impact. Area effects such
as a dragon’s breath will cause all images to vanish.</p>
<p>Also useful for intimidating the credulous. Become a
multi-wizard.</p>
<p><strong>5. Mirror Object</strong></p>
<p><em>R: touch T: mirror D: [dice] hours / concentration+1
minute</em></p>
<p>You reach into a mirror-like surface and pull out a copy of an object
adjacent to the mirror. The object that you pull out must be within
reach of the mirror (as if it were a window), small enough to fit
through the mirror (as if it were a window) and light enough for you to
pull through with one hand.</p>
<p>The mirror object looks and feels exactly like the object it copied.
It doesn’t copy any magical properties of the object. You cannot
duplicate living things in this way.</p>
<p>The mirror object pops like a bubble if it suffers a solid blow . If
you invest at least 4 [dice] into this spell, it can copy the magical
properties of an item, but those magical properties will only function
once. For items with continuous properties, such as a flying carpet, the
magic properties will last no longer than 10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>6. Light</strong></p>
<p><em>R: touch T: object or creature D: [dice]x2 hours</em></p>
<p>Object illuminates as a torch, with a radius of 20’+[dice]x10’. You
can chose the color of the light.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can make an attack roll against a sighted
creature. If you succeed, the creature is blinded for [sum] rounds. If
[sum] is greater than 12, the creature is permanently blinded.</p>
<p>If you invest 4 [dice] or more this light has all the qualities of
natural sunlight. Alternatively, if you invest 4 [dice] or more the
light can be purest octarine, although it will only last for 1 round.
Octarine light is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Light sources in the dungeon are very valuable. At one [dice], this
spell is a slightly worse emergency torch, but at two [dice] it is
already significantly better. And what does pure octarine light do
anyway? At a minimum, I’d say [sum] damage to all sighted creatures in
the area, plus whatever mutations, mishaps, summonings, and explosions
the GM cares to inflict.</p>
<p>Mad Illusionists build special mirror-cages and wear visors tinted
with the bones of extremely dull bureaucrats.</p>
<p><strong>7. Hypnotic Orb</strong></p>
<p><em>R: touch T: object D: [sum] minutes / concentration+1
minute</em></p>
<p>You enchant a mostly-spherical object so that it’s surface is covered
with a captivating, shimmering pattern. Any creature who sees the
enchanted object must pass a WIS Save or be compelled to sit still and
observe it for the spell’s duration. Flying creatures will land or
circle it.</p>
<p>The caster is not immune to this effect. The effect is broken if line
of sight is broken, if something startles a target (a loud adjacent
shout), or if the target see signs of obvious danger (such as someone
killing their friends). Groups of statistically identical NPCs should
make their save as a group.</p>
<p><strong>8. Colour Spray</strong></p>
<p><em>R: [dice]x10’ cone T: sighted creatures D: 0 / varies</em></p>
<p>If [sum] is equal or greater to the creature’s HD, it is
incapacitated for 1d6 rounds. If [sum] is three times the creature’s HD
or more, it is stunned for a round, then incapacitated for 1d6 rounds.
If [sum] is five times the creature’s HD, it is stunned for 1d6 rounds,
then incapacitated for 1d6 rounds.</p>
<p><strong>9. Wizard Vision</strong></p>
<p><em>R: touch T: sighted creature D: [sum] min x2 / permanent</em></p>
<p>If you invest one [die]: Target can see invisible things. Target can
see through illusions. Non- magical disguises are not penetrated.</p>
<p>If you invest two or more [dice]: This can only be cast on yourself.
As above, except you can also see through magical darkness, and see the
true forms of shapeshifters. There are also some permanent effects: (a)
You can forever see invisible things as a slight warping or lensing of
light. You know “there’s something over there” and what size it roughly
is, but nothing else. (b) You can tell if someone else is a spellcaster
by looking them in the eyes.</p>
<p>The price for this gift is your mind. You suffer a permanent loss of
1d6 Wisdom (as you reject the true nature of Creation and go slightly
mad) or 1d6 Charisma (as you accept the true nature of Creation and
alienate yourself from your peers).</p>
<p><strong>10. Wall of Light</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: wall or sphere D: 10 min / concentration+1
minute</em></p>
<p>You conjure either (a) a hemisphere [dice]x5’ in diameter, or (b) a
10’ by 10’ panel per [dice], which can be arranged in any contiguous
formation joined by their edges. The wall is intangible, but you can
control what each side shows. It can be either (a) inky darkness, (b)
light out to 30’, (c) mirror, (d) transparency, or (e) a simple texture,
such as stone, brick, or carpet. Both sides do not have to show the same
thing. You can change these surfaces with a thought.</p>
<p>If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, you may make the
duration permanent.</p>
<p><strong>EMBLEM SPELLS</strong></p>
<p><strong>11. Mirror Self</strong></p>
<p><em>R: touch T: mirror D: concentration+1 minute</em></p>
<p>You reach into a mirror-like surface and pull out [dice] copies of
yourself. The mirror must be large enough for you to pass through.</p>
<p>Your mirror clones behave as you wish. They can walk and talk, but it
cannot pick anything up. You can see through their eyes and hear through
their ears. You can cast spells through them. You can switch places with
your mirror twin(s) as a free action.</p>
<p>A mirror twin pops like a bubble if it suffers a solid blow. If
concentration is lost you have 2 rounds to regain it. Once you learn
this spell, expect the Illusionist in the mirror to reach out and copy
you from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>12. Fade</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: creature or object D: [sum] rounds</em></p>
<p>Target phases out and becomes unable to affect the world in any way
except visually. It stands or floats like an illusion until the spell
concludes. Not even magic can affect the target.</p>
<p>If they would be inside a solid object when the spell expires, they
are harmlessly shunted into the nearest open space. The maximum size of
the object depends on how many dice are invested in the spell: 1 [dice]:
human- sized, 2 [dice]: ogre- or wagon-sized, 3 [dice]: dragon- or
tavern-sized, [dice]: ship- or bridge-sized.</p>
<p>Fade a bridge away. Fade your enemy away and then have the fighter
line up for a two- handed baseball bat swing at their neck.</p>
<p><strong>ILLUSIONIST MISHAPS</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours</p></li>
<li><p>Take 1d6 damage</p></li>
<li><p>Random mutation (page 86) for 1d6 rounds, then Save vs
Constitution or it’s permanent.</p></li>
<li><p>Blind for 1d6 rounds (you can’t cast spells)</p></li>
<li><p>All sighted creatures are invisible to you for 24hrs.</p></li>
<li><p>Eruption of random illusions from your hands. Everyone in LOS
must make a WIS Save to do anything relying on sight for 1d6
rounds.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>DOOM OF THE ILLUSIONIST</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A 10’ square mirror appears and you are compelled to enter. Your
lose a random item, gain a random item of approximately equal value, and
have 1 HP. You return the next morning, shivering.</p></li>
<li><p>You turn into an illusion for a day.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn into an illusion permanently.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As an illusion, you have no smell or taste. You cannot be felt. Solid
impacts cause you to pop. Lose 1d6 Con that cannot be recovered while
you are an illusion, and reform the next morning nearby. Illusions are
real to you. (1) is a neat idea. Mirror realms are always fun. 0 HP
isn’t the worst penalty either. You’ll get some of it back at lunch. (2)
and (3) are… really bad. Illusions being real to you does mean you can
walk across an illusory bridge or ride an illusory dragon into battle,
but you’re going to pop a lot.</p>
<p>This doom can be avoided by journeying into the mirror-realm and
eating one of the eyes of the beholders found there, or performing the
Ritual of Prismax; a duel to the death against three of your mirror
selves, fought in a neutral battlefield.</p>
<h2 id="necromancer"><strong>NECROMANCER</strong></h2>
<p>Necromancers are outlawed and outcast wizards. Their profession is a
curse; their very name a byword for unholy acts and blasphemous deeds.
Yet the necromancers persist on the fringes of society. They provide a
relatively safe channel between the living and the dead, and someone
will always pay – one way or another – for information only the dead can
provide.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> Spellbook, ink, quill, dark
robes and a bone mask. You can wear light armor but would probably
prefer magic robes?</p>
<p><strong>A: +1 MD, +1 Signature Spell (1d6), Spellcasting,
Cantrips</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: +1 MD, +1 Signature Spell (1d8), Book Casting, Necrotic
Recovery, Death’s Touch</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: +1 MD, +1 Signature Spell (1d10), Cold Flesh</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: +1 MD, Master of Magic, Spell Creation, Iron
Will</strong></p>
<p>You gain +1 Magic Die (MD) and +1 Signature Spell for each
Necromancer template you possess, to a maximum of 4 each (templates
&amp; MD).</p>
<p>When you first gain an Necromancer template, you cannot multiclass
into other spellcasting classes, though you may gain templates from
other Adventurer or otherwise magical classes.</p>
<p>When you select Template A, roll 1d6 gain the spell listed as a
<strong>Signature Spell</strong>. You can repeat this process for each
<strong>Int</strong> ability bonus you have (but you can also reserve
this for spells you find while adventuring). When you receive Template
B, roll 1d8. Template C, roll 1d10. If a duplicate spell is rolled,
select the spell above or below it on the list.</p>
<p>As you level, you will gain spells from your class’s spell list. You
still can learn and cast spells from outside your school.</p>
<p>All of your MD return if you get a <strong>Good Night’s
Rest</strong>. If you didn’t sleep well or your rest was disrupted by a
hazard or combat, make a <strong>WIS save</strong> for each MD to have
them return to your pool anyway.</p>
<p><strong>A: Spellcasting.</strong> You gain the ability to cast
spells. See <strong>Magic and Spells</strong> for details on how
spellcasting works.</p>
<p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You require a ritual ingredient to cast
your spells. The ingredient has a negligible cost (2cp) and is not
consumed, but water, fire, or isolation could render you unable to cast
spells. Roll on the Ritual Ingredient List below.</p>
<p><strong>A: Cantrips</strong> You have mastered minor magics:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You can call on the spirit of a recently dead creature by
interrogating its body. Provided the creature died before dawn, and it
wasn’t particularly pious or exceptionally blasphemous, it will answer 3
of your questions. At dawn, the spirit departs. The dead are rarely
coherent or helpful.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answers may be cryptic. If the creature had 3 or more HD, everyone
present can see and hear the spirit. Otherwise, only you can see it.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>You can ritually protect a corpse against possession by unwelcome
spirits. Alternatively, you can deliberately invite spirits to possess a
corpse. The ritual takes 10 minutes. The most dangerous time is between
death and dawn; after that, the corpse becomes less appealing to
wandering spirits.</p></li>
<li><p>You can permanently lose 1 HP to add 1 MD to a spell you are
casting. You can only lose 1 HP per spell.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>B: Book Casting.</strong> You can cast spells from a
spellbook or scroll without making them a <strong>Signature
Spell</strong>. See <strong>Magic and Spells</strong> for details on how
book casting works.</p>
<p><strong>B: Necrotic Recovery.</strong> During <strong>Lunch</strong>
you can attempt to recover one lost MD. <strong>Save vs WIS</strong> to
return a lost MD to your pool.</p>
<p><strong>B: Death’s Touch.</strong> You can cause creatures you touch
to reroll any Scars they accumulated during that Turn. You can allow
them to reroll detrimental results or force them to reroll beneficial
results. If a creature successfully removes a detrimental Scars result
because of the reroll you provided, it permanently loses 1 HP.</p>
<p><strong>C: Cold Flesh.</strong> You no longer require sleep and feel
pain only in an abstract sense.</p>
<p><strong>D: Master of Magic.</strong> Learn any 5 spells from your
spell list.</p>
<p>With the proper materials, time, and a wizard’s sanctum you can now
create magic items.</p>
<p><strong>D: Spell Creation.</strong> See Wizard class description for
details.</p>
<p><strong>D: Iron Will.</strong> You can control the results of your
spellcasting through your iron will. <strong>Save vs WIS</strong> to
change the result of one of your rolled MD by one point. This can be
used to increase the effect of your spell or avoid a
<strong>Mishap</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>NECROMANCER SPELL LIST</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Raise Spirit.</strong></p>
<p>You automatically gain this spell at first level. Roll for your other
spell normally.</p>
<p><em>R: touch T: spirit D: [sum] minutes</em></p>
<p>After a ritual that takes 10 minutes, you call out to the spirit of a
dead person. The spirit can be anyone, from long-dead kings to
newly-murdered party members. You do not need the creature’s body. This
spell can only be cast between sunset and dawn. Roll 1d6 on the table
below, modified by the following:</p>
<p><strong>Bonuses</strong></p>
<p>+1 for each [die] invested in this spell +1 if the spirit died within
a week</p>
<p>+1 if the spirit has unfinished business in Creation</p>
<p>+1 if you know the spirit’s true name</p>
<p>+4 if you personally knew the creature before it died</p>
<p><strong>Penalties</strong></p>
<p>-1 for each of the creature’s original HD</p>
<p>-1 if the spirit was a wizard</p>
<p>-1 if the spirit is angry or irritated with you</p>
<p>-2 if you have only a vague name or description</p>
<p>-4 if the spirit was a necromancer or had significant magical powers
in life Other bonuses and penalties at the GM’s discretion. The stronger
the soul, the more dangerous the summon.</p>
<p><strong>Raise Spirit Result.</strong> 0 or negative: The spirit is
raised, but lashes out in anger and annoyance. You take 2d6 damage. If
this damage reduces you to 0 HP, you are dragged straight to the
afterlife (no Save). Alternatively, the spirit casts Fatal Doom (see
below) on you.</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> The spirit is raised, but it cannot be put down.
If there is a corpse nearby the spirit will possess it. Otherwise, it
will act as a disembodied undead of appropriate HD.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> The wrong spirit is raised. It may be more or
less useful than the intended spirit.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> The spirit is raised, but its answers are mocking
and cruel.</p>
<p><strong>d.</strong> The spirit is raised and answers your questions
truthfully.</p>
<p><strong>e.</strong> The spirit is raised and also provides a useful
answer to a question you did not ask.</p>
<p><strong>f.</strong> The spirit is raised and remains for 1d6
additional minutes.</p>
<p><strong>g.</strong> or higher. The spirit is raised, and can be given
one command (as per the Command Undead spell below.)</p>
<p><strong>2. Explode Corpse.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: corpse D: 0</em></p>
<p>Target corpse explodes, dealing damage in a [dice]x5’ radius, Save vs
DEX for half. The maximum damage dealt is dependent on the creature’s
size:</p>
<p>Rat: 1</p>
<p>Dog: 1d6</p>
<p>Human: 2d6</p>
<p>Cow: 3d6</p>
<p>Elephant: 6d6</p>
<p>Whale: 8d6</p>
<p>This spell cannot target undead creatures unless you control
them.</p>
<p><strong>3. Death Mask.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: touch T: humanoid corpse D: varies</em></p>
<p>You touch a corpse and the face peels off like a mask. The rest of
the corpse shrivels up and flakes into dust. When you (and only you)
wear the mask, you will look and sound like the person whose face you’re
wearing, but only to sentient people (no effect on animals, spirits, or
elementals). The mask will rot into uselessness after [sum] days. If
[dice] is at least 4, the mask is permanent.</p>
<p><strong>4. Fear.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: creatures up to [sum] HD D: 0</em></p>
<p>Target creatures must Save vs Fear or take a morale check, modified
by your CHA bonus, or flee from you. If you cast this spell with 4
[dice], creatures unused to supernatural occurrences (peasants,
domesticated dogs, etc.) must also Save vs WIS or age 2d10 years.</p>
<p><strong>5. Rot.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: touch T: creature or object D: 0</em></p>
<p>Creatures take 2x[dice] damage, CON Save for half. Creatures also age
2d10 years (no mechanical effect), and may develop grey hair, shakes,
and wrinkles. Objects are aged according to how many [dice] are
invested. Books sprout into mold, wood becomes soggy, lamps run out of
fuel and grow cold, and stone is entirely unaffected. 1 [die]: [sum]
days. 2 [dice]: [sum] months. 3 [dice] or more: [sum] years. Undead are
healed for [sum]+[dice] HP, or 1 permanent HP is restored (to the former
maximum).</p>
<p><strong>6. Raise Undead.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 20’ T: [dice]x2 HD corpse D: 2 hours</em></p>
<p>Target is raised as a specific type of undead that is obedient to the
caster. The creature is animated by a specially developed spell or an
obedient ghost. When the spell’s duration ends, the undead may collapse,
and cannot be raised again or used for any further spells.</p>
<p>The type of undead raised depends on the target and the [dice]
invested.</p>
<p>1 [die] : 1-2 HD creature : corpse snake, crawling claw, skeleton,
zombie</p>
<p>2 [dice] : 1-4 HD creature : wight</p>
<p>3 [dice] : 1-6 HD creature : war spirit, mummy</p>
<p>4 [dice] : 1-8 HD creature : something impressively terrifying</p>
<p>Undead typically have reduced stats compared to their living form.
Undead of 5 HD or less are nearly mindless. If you die while undead are
under your control, the spell’s duration expires, or you try to end the
spell, there is a [HD]-in-10 chance the undead remains active.
Otherwise, it collapses.</p>
<p>Instead of letting the spell expire, you can keep the [dice] you
spent on the spell invested. The spell’s duration becomes permanent as
long as those [dice] remain invested. Alternatively, if you spend 4
[dice] to raise a 1 or 2 HD creature, the spell’s duration becomes
permanent and no [dice] need to be invested. Creatures may retain some
special abilities they had in life.</p>
<p><strong>7. Innocent Revenant.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: Touch T: corpse D: 0</em></p>
<p>A creature of [dice] HD or less that died in the last 3 turns
immediately returns as an undead version of itself with full HP. The HD
requirement is ignored if the target is well known to you (a fellow PC,
for example). This revenant can never gain HP, and loses 1 HP, and 1
point of INT and WIS to a minimum of 5, every hour until it reaches 0 HP
and disintegrates. This HP loss can be healed by the Rot spell or other
effects that heal undead creatures. The revenant is unaware that it ever
died, even ignoring obvious signs of death (no heartbeat, cold flesh,
gaping wounds). However, if someone else insists on confronting them
with evidence of their own death, they fly into a rage, becoming a
mindless undead.</p>
<p>A necromancer can “accidentally” kill a friend using their class’
Perk, then raise them as an Innocent Revenant, then heal them with Rot
or control them with Command Undead.</p>
<p><strong>8. Command Undead.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: person D: [dice] hours</em></p>
<p>Target: 1 undead creature that can hear and understand you. You shout
a single-word command to your target, who must Save vs WIS or obey. If
the command lasts more than a single round, intelligent undead, or
undead under the control of another necromancer, get a new Save at the
beginning of each of their rounds. You can spend additional [dice] to
increase the effects.</p>
<p>+1 MD: Affect +2 targets.</p>
<p>+1 MD: You may increase then length of your command by +2 words.</p>
<p>+1 MD: You may increase the duration between checks by +2 rounds.</p>
<p><strong>9. Fog.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 30’ T: self D: [dice] hours</em></p>
<p>You breath out a bunch of fog, filing an area [dice]x20’ in radius.
No one can see beyond 10’ in the fog. Undead can see through the fog. If
you invest 4 [dice], you can instead breath out a layer of thick
grey-yellow clouds that block sunlight for the spell’s duration, for 3
miles in every direction.</p>
<p><strong>10. Death Scythe.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: touch T: corpse D: [dice]x10 min</em></p>
<p>The corpse disintegrates as you pluck a black scythe from its chest.
The scythe deals 1d8+Strength Bonus damage. It deals double damage to
creatures of the same type as the corpse used to create the scythe (so a
scythe drawn from a troll’s body would deal double damage to
trolls).</p>
<p><strong>EMBLEM SPELLS</strong></p>
<p><strong>11. Finger of Death.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: creature D: 0</em></p>
<p>Target living creature must make a CON Save or die. Creatures with a
significant magical nature gain a bonus equal to their HD. Frail mortal
creatures may not get a Save. This spell requires 2 [dice] to cast
against a creature of 5 HD or less, 3 [dice] for a creature between 6
and 8 HD, and 4 [dice] for creatures with more HD.</p>
<p><strong>12. Fatal Doom.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 10’ T: creature D: permanent</em></p>
<p>You must invest 4 [dice] to cast this spell, and you also drop to 0
HP. You pronounce a Fatal Doom upon a living creature. The creature must
have asked you for advice, in a non- casual capacity. They must have
asked you what to do, where to go, how to overcome an enemy, or a
glimpse into the future.</p>
<p>Instead of calling on a spirit, you read the future directly. You may
describe (in one or two sentences, clear or cryptic) what will happen to
the target, and how they will die.</p>
<p>The Doom is inevitable and irreversible. The GM may alter details and
circumstances, but if you say that the target will be hounded from his
home by those he loves and devoured by wolves in the forest, that’s how
he’s going to die - and soon. Nothing else will kill the target until
the Fatal Doom has come to pass.</p>
<p><strong>BECOMING A LICH</strong></p>
<p>You need to breed and research 8 specific spells. The spells don’t do
anything alone, but they modify your soul to withstand the terrors of
undeath with your mind intact. You are essentially breeding and then
grafting spells onto your soul. Since no active liches will teach you
the spells they used, and records of spell development are fragmentary
at best, each lich must forge their own path. Some succeed; many fail,
and fade away into half-mad shadows or disappear screaming into Hell.
Other liches become trapped in living worlds of madness and memory,
unable to accept their new form or the changing times. History is full
of Immortal Tyrants; they never quite manage to rule the empires they
desire.</p>

<p><strong>NECROMANCER MISHAPS</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours</p></li>
<li><p>Take 1d6 damage</p></li>
<li><p>Random mutation (page 86) for 1d6 rounds, then Save vs
Constitution or it’s permanent.</p></li>
<li><p>Save vs Fear against the target of your spell. 1d6 rounds. Target
is fully healed if undead.</p></li>

</ol>
<p><strong>DOOM OF THE NECROMANCER</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You die and spend the next 1d6 days wandering Creation as a
disembodied, feeble spirit. Your body will rot after 2 days unless it is
preserved in some way: pickling, embalming, freezing, or desiccation. If
you inhabit a rotting body, you become undead.</p></li>
<li><p>You become undead, permanently. If you were already undead, you
instead lose 6 HP permanently.</p></li>
<li><p>By direct decree of the Caretaker, all corpses in 20 miles rise
as zombies and skeletons and attempt to kill you. If you have been
particularly notorious, they will be accompanied by 2 Bell Exorcists and
a demon. Average: 3d20 skeletons, with 1d6 lieutenants, monsters, and
commanders as appropriate. Anyone they kill joins them. They will pursue
you to the ends of the earth.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This doom can be avoided by eating the heart of an immortal creature,
or journeying into hell and make a bargain to serve the Lord of Death,
or by becoming a Lich.</p>
<h2 id="witch"><strong>WITCH</strong></h2>
<p>More accurately called an Animist Wizard. These are the “bad”
wizards. The ones who live in shacks on the edge of town or in castles
on the edge of reality. They are the cursed ones, robed in black, who
you seek when all other hopes fail. When family turns their back on you,
when you scream curses into the night, when your very soul burns, then
you are in need of an Animist Wizard… or ready to become one.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> Spellbook, ink, quill, practical
traveling robes. You can wear light armor but would probably prefer
magic robes?</p>
<p><strong>A: +1 MD, +1 Signature Spell (1d6), Spellcasting,
Cantrips</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: +1 MD, +1 Signature Spell (1d8), Book Casting, Hex
Recovery, Bonded Words</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: +1 MD, +1 Signature Spell (1d10), Hex</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: +1 MD, Master of Magic, Spell Creation, Iron
Will</strong></p>
<p>You gain +1 Magic Die (MD) and +1 Signature Spell for each Witch
template you possess, to a maximum of 4 each (templates &amp; MD).</p>
<p>When you first gain an Witch template, you cannot multiclass into
other spellcasting classes, though you may gain templates from other
Adventurer or otherwise magical classes.</p>
<p>When you select Template A, roll 1d6 gain the spell listed as a
<strong>Signature Spell</strong>. You can repeat this process for each
<strong>Int</strong> ability bonus you have (but you can also reserve
this for spells you find while adventuring). When you receive Template
B, roll 1d8. Template C, roll 1d10. If a duplicate spell is rolled,
select the spell above or below it on the list.</p>
<p>As you level, you will gain spells from your class’s spell list. You
still can learn and cast spells from outside your school.</p>
<p>All of your MD return if you get a <strong>Good Night’s
Rest</strong>. If you didn’t sleep well or your rest was disrupted by a
hazard or combat, make a <strong>WIS save</strong> for each MD to have
them return to your pool anyway.</p>
<p><strong>A: Spellcasting.</strong> You gain the ability to cast
spells. See <strong>Magic and Spells</strong> for details on how
spellcasting works. The Witch’ spellcasting ability is
<strong>INT</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You are feared and distrusted by most. You
cannot bathe. You can never return another person’s love.</p>
<p><strong>A: Cantrips</strong> You have mastered minor magics:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Transform into a creature with your face that has either (a) a
fly speed of twice 2x Movement, (b) 3x Movement (c) swim speed of 2x
Movement, (d) burrow speed of Movement, (e) the ability to squeeze
through gaps smaller than a human head. Choose one option at character
creation. The transformation lasts for 1hr per Animist wizard template
per day.</p></li>
<li><p>Dim or extinguish all non-magical light sources within
10’.</p></li>
<li><p>Touch someone to learn if they have killed another sentient
creature in the last 24hrs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>B: Book Casting.</strong> You can cast spells from a
spellbook or scroll without making them a <strong>Signature
Spell</strong>. See <strong>Magic and Spells</strong> for details on how
book casting works.</p>
<p><strong>B: Hex Recovery.</strong> During <strong>Lunch</strong> you
can attempt to recover one lost MD. <strong>Save vs WIS</strong> to
return a lost MD to your pool.</p>
<p><strong>B: Bonded Words.</strong> If someone makes a bargain with you
and breaks it, <strong>save vs WIS</strong>. If you pass, you instantly
know about it. Your spells can target parasites and unborn children
without targeting their hosts. What counts as a “parasite” is up to the
Referee.</p>
<p><strong>C: Hex.</strong> You bring misfortune on a creature you see.
Spend an Action to impose <strong>Disadvantage</strong> on the
creature’s next roll. The creature gets to <strong>save vs WIS</strong>
to resist. On a success <strong>Disadvanatge</strong> is reduced to a
<strong>-2</strong> modifier.</p>
<p><strong>D: Master of Magic.</strong> Learn any 5 spells from your
spell list.</p>
<p>With the proper materials, time, and a wizard’s sanctum you can now
create magic items.</p>
<p><strong>D: Spell Creation.</strong> See Wizard class description for
details.</p>
<p><strong>D: Iron Will.</strong> You can control the results of your
spellcasting through your iron will. <strong>Save vs WIS</strong> to
change the result of one of your rolled MD by one point. This can be
used to increase the effect of your spell or avoid a
<strong>Mishap</strong>.</p>
<p>** WITCH SPELL LIST**</p>
<p><strong>1. Powerful Presence.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 0 T: self D: [dice] hours</em></p>
<p>The caster seems to grow in magnificence and poise, and gains
+2x[dice] bonus to Save vs Domination, Charm, or Fear effects. Easily
frightened creatures (horses, mice, guilt- ridden murderers) must test
Morale or flee before the caster. A very minor fear-like effect combined
with a long-duration buff. This is stage magic. You grow 2” taller and
much more sinister.</p>
<p><strong>2. Telekinetic Shove.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50‘ T: creature or object D: 0</em></p>
<p>An object or creature within range is hurled through the air. Save to
negate. A human- sized creature travels 10’ per [dice], and takes 1d6
damage for every 10’ traveled. A creature thrown at another creature
requires an Attack roll to hit and inflicts 1d6 damage for every 10’
traveled. This spell will also blow open all the closed but unlocked
doors in a room, shatter all the windows in a building, or knock the
thatched roof off a peasant’s shack.</p>
<p><strong>3. Shrivel.</strong></p>
<p><em>R. 50’ T: [dice] creatures D: varies</em></p>
<p>CON Save negates. Target loses half of its current HP and loses
[dice] Strength (affecting the damage it deals). When the spell ends,
the lost HP and Strength returns. If you cast this spell with 3 or more
[dice] against a single target, the lost HP does not return, and the
Strength damage is permanent. The apparent age of the target increases
considerably for the spell’s duration. Dramatic hand gestures are
mandatory.</p>
<p><strong>4. Control Water.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: a bucket’s worth of water D: concentration</em></p>
<p>Control a small amount of water within 50’. At one [die]: (a) propel
a small boat, (b) carry a small item through the water, (c) allow
someone to swim at 2x speed, (d) force someone to swim at half speed,
(e) splash something no more than 5’ away, (f) dry something that is
wet, (g) freeze a small amount of water, (h) cool a hot cup of tea. Each
[dice] you invest increases the effects.</p>
<p>Good luck adjudicating this one, but you get the idea. With 4 [dice]
you should be able to sink a ship or turn back a river. Something
equivalent to a full-blast fireball. Water spirits carry means of
purifying corruption, and Animists know their secret ways.</p>
<p><strong>5. Sleep</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: [sum] HD of creatures D: varies</em></p>
<p>Target falls into a magical slumber, and can’t be awoken by anything
less vigorous than a slap (a standard action). If [sum] is at least 4
times the creature’s HD, the duration becomes permanent (until slapped)
and the creature no longer needs to eat or drink while sleeping. If you
also invested 3 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes
permanent, and you can set the only condition that will cause the
creature to awake (the sunrise before the apocalypse, true love’s kiss,
etc.) Undead, creatures immune to being charmed, and mindless creatures
are not affected.</p>
<p><strong>6. Charm Person.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: person D: [dice] hours</em></p>
<p>The person regards you as a good friend and ignores the obvious spell
you just cast on them. If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell,
the duration becomes permanent.</p>
<p>So not dragons, dryads, owlbears, ants, elementals, or angels.
People. If it’s worried about taxes, gossips, and wears pants, it’s a
person. This effect overrides the drawback of being an Animist Wizard,
but not for long.</p>
<p><strong>7. Dream Eater.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50‘ T: creature D: 0</em></p>
<p>A sleeping creature within 50’ takes [sum] damage. The caster heals
for the same amount. No save. When you gain this spell, if you don’t
know Sleep already, you learn it the next time you would roll to gain a
spell. It replaces one of the spells you’d roll for. This spell doesn’t
work on creatures that don’t dream (snails, worms, bureaucrats).</p>
<p><strong>8. Scorching Ray.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 100’ T: creatures or objects D: 0</em></p>
<p>Fire a ray at a target, dealing 1d10 fire damage with a successful
attack roll. Each dice you invest in this spell allow you to fire an
additional ray at the same target or at a new target. Creatures are not
set on fire, but very flammable objects such as candles, dry straw, or
paper will catch fire 1 round after being struck. Instead of using this
spell to deal damage, you can instead use it to light all the candles in
a single room.</p>
<p>The fire conjured by an animist wizard is a dark and greasy sort, an
outcast spirit.</p>
<p><strong>9. Scry</strong></p>
<p><em>R: [dice]x100’ T: point in space D: concentration</em></p>
<p>You conjure an invisible, intangible, floating eyeball to a point in
space that you designate. Unlike most spells, you do not have to have
line of sight to cast it. As long as you maintain concentration, you can
see through this sensor with your normal senses. This spell requires
something to scry on, usually a mirror, quiet pool, clouds, or bonfire.
If you invest 2 or more [dice], you can also hear through the sensor (it
grows an ear). If you invest at 3 or more [dice], you can also speak
through the sensor (it grows a dribbly little mouth). If you use an
actual crystal ball when casting this spell, the range is instead [dice]
miles. Crystal balls are rare enough that they are never offered for
sale, but are worth upwards of 3,000 gp. Most are ancestral relics.</p>
<p><strong>10.Alter Self.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 0 T: self D: [dice]x10 minutes</em></p>
<p>Alter your form to resemble that of another creature of your type
(usually humanoid). You do not gain any special abilities from this
transformation.</p>
<p>You can’t alter your smell, and you can’t hide from Wizard Vision or
an angry mob forever.</p>
<p><strong>EMBLEM SPELLS</strong></p>
<p><strong>11. Doom.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: creature D: concentration</em></p>
<p>Target feels cold. If you invest 3 [dice] or more, and you loudly
pronounce doom on them for the next 2 turns (without being interrupted
or breaking line of sight), target dies on the 3rd turn. You need to
truly hate the target for this spell to work, or convince yourself that
you hate the target. Even a sliver of pity cancels the spell.</p>
<p>You can kill anything with this spell. You might need to test Wisdom
or Charisma to prove you really hate a target.</p>
<p><strong>12. Curse.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: mortal creature D: permanent</em></p>
<p>You inflict a Minor or Major curse on the target. For a minor curse,
you must invest 2 [dice]. For a major curse, you must invest 4 [dice].
Dice used to cast this spell are automatically exhausted. You cannot
dispel your own curses. (<strong>Curse table</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>WITCH’ CURSES</strong></p>
<p>These are only examples. Roll randomly, pick a curse, or inflict
something thematic.</p>
<p>Cursed people need to have their curse identified (by a priest, a
hermit, a madman, a fairy, etc.). Identification also reveals the way to
remove the curse. You can also try all sorts of risky exorcisms and
rituals to get rid of the curse instead. Some of the effects seem
severe, but remember, they could be “just die” instead. Curses should be
appropriate to the target, their sins, and the caster’s whims.</p>

<li><p>Your transformation becomes permanent. You become bestial and

</ol>
<p>This doom can be avoided by true love, or by slaying the last of a
powerful species (black dragons, elder trees, creation elementals,
abandoned gods).</p>
<p><strong>WITCH NOTES</strong></p>
<p>People make the sign against the evil eye when you pass. Shops close.
You will never find true love unless you renounce your class and powers,
although you might find corrupted substitutes. That’s the deal you made.
Take the corruption of the world into yourself for sheer power, or to
improve the rest of Creation. Do what can be done, or what needs to be
done. Also, being dunked in the water accidentally doesn’t count as a
bath. You need to do it deliberately to clean yourself.</p>
<p>Your transformation grows to corrupt you, or your corruption grows to
transform you. Difficult to say. Eventually, you’re going to turn on
your friends and devour them. True love requires you to love someone
back, and that means giving up your powers forever.</p>
<h2 id="vivimancer"><strong>VIVIMANCER</strong></h2>
<p>To a vivimancer, their and everyone else’s flesh is clay to be shaped
and moulded. To everyone else, they’re mad spellcasters who bring
mutation, mutant vermin, and Cronenbergian horrors. Not welcome
anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> Thick robes and hood, carving
knife, spellbook and quill.</p>
<p><strong>A: +1 MD, +1 Signature Spell (1d6), Spellcasting,
Cantrips</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: +1 MD, +1 Signature Spell (1d8), Book Casting, Vital
Recovery, Revivify</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: +1 MD, +1 Signature Spell (1d10), Body
Control</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: +1 MD, Master of Magic, Spell Creation, Iron
Will</strong></p>
<p>You gain +1 Magic Die (MD) and +1 Signature Spell for each
Vivimancerh template you possess, to a maximum of 4 each (templates
&amp; MD).</p>
<p>When you first gain a Vivimancer template, you cannot multiclass into
other spellcasting classes, though you may gain templates from other
Adventurer or otherwise magical classes.</p>
<p>When you select Template A, roll 1d6 gain the spell listed as a
<strong>Signature Spell</strong>. You can repeat this process for each
<strong>Int</strong> ability bonus you have (but you can also reserve
this for spells you find while adventuring). When you receive Template
B, roll 1d8. Template C, roll 1d10. If a duplicate spell is rolled,
select the spell above or below it on the list.</p>
<p>As you level, you will gain spells from your class’s spell list. You
still can learn and cast spells from outside your school.</p>
<p>All of your MD return if you get a <strong>Good Night’s
Rest</strong>. If you didn’t sleep well or your rest was disrupted by a
hazard or combat, make a <strong>WIS save</strong> for each MD to have
them return to your pool anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Spellcasting</strong> You gain the ability to cast spells.
See <strong>Magic and Spells</strong> for details on how spellcasting
works. The Vivimancer’s spellcasting ability is
<strong>INT</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Drawback</strong> Whenever you receive magical healing
(except for Regeneration), <strong>Save vs CON</strong> or roll for a
random permanent mutation. Start with 1 random mutation.</p>
<p><strong>Cantrips</strong></p>
<p>1 Taste blood to know what kind of creature it came from.</p>
<p>2 Transfer a blemish or cosmetic creature from one creature to
another. (eg frog warts to a princess, swap hair colour) You cannot swap
major features (eg limbs, wings, tails).</p>
<p><strong>B: Book Casting.</strong> You can cast spells from a
spellbook or scroll without making them a <strong>Signature
Spell</strong>. See <strong>Magic and Spells</strong> for details on how
book casting works.</p>
<p><strong>B: Vital Recovery.</strong> During <strong>Lunch</strong> you
can attempt to recover one lost MD. <strong>Save vs WIS</strong> to
return a lost MD to your pool.</p>
<p><strong>B: Revivify.</strong> Once per day, with a single action,
your body can either: regain 2d6 HP; get a <strong>Save vs CON</strong>
to shrug off the effects of a poison, get a <strong>Save vs CON</strong>
to rid yourself of a disease, or <strong>Save vs CON</strong> to remove
1 <strong>Fatigue</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>C: Body Control.</strong> Once per day, for a single Random
Mutation you have, you can re-roll on the random mutation table once per
day and change it.</p>
<p><strong>D: Master of Magic.</strong> Learn any 5 spells from your
spell list.</p>
<p>With the proper materials, time, and a wizard’s sanctum you can now
create magic items.</p>
<p><strong>D: Spell Creation.</strong> See Wizard class description for
details.</p>
<p><strong>D: Iron Will.</strong> You can control the results of your
spellcasting through your iron will. <strong>Save vs WIS</strong> to
change the result of one of your rolled MD by one point. This can be
used to increase the effect of your spell or avoid a
<strong>Mishap</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="other-magical-classes"><strong>OTHER MAGICAL
CLASSES</strong></h1>
<h2 id="cleric"><strong>CLERIC</strong></h2>
<p>A cleric channels their faith into minor miracles.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> light armor, weapon of choice,
small collection of charms &amp; talismans.</p>
<p><strong>A: Relics Icons &amp; Charms, +2 Canticles (1d4), +1
HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Natural Philosophy, +1 Canticle (1d6), +1 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Signs &amp; Portents, +1 Canticle (1d8), +1
HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Witch Hunter, +3 Canticles (choose), +1 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Relics, Icons, &amp; Charms.</strong> Clerics channel
divine energy through the unique collection of holy trinkets, amulets,
jewelry, talismans, masks and other reliquaries of their god they have
collected. When you acquire Template A, you automatically receive 1
relic. Additional relics have to be acquired during adventuring.</p>
<p>RICs function as divine batteries. You have a number of faith dice
(<strong>FD</strong>) equal to the number of item slots you dedicate to
these objects. They otherwise function like magic dice. Armor does not
interfere with Faith Dice beyond the competition for inventory
slots.</p>
<p>You use your Faith Die to fuel Canticles. Roll a d4 twice to
determine your starting canticles. With Template B roll 1d6 and randomly
gain a new canticle. Roll a d8 with Template C. With Template D select
any 3 new canticles.</p>
<p>You may invest a number of FD equal to your Level+1 (max of 6 FD) per
casting.</p>
<p><strong>B: Natural Philosophy.</strong> A cleric’s study of extends
beyond scripture, it involves the close study of body, mind, and
soul.</p>
<p>This leads to a strong working knowledge of herblore, the four basic
humors, and the needs of the soul.</p>
<p>With a healer’s kit, you may create a single poultice, paste, or tea
that will restore an additional 1D6 HP to whomever it is administered
during a break for <strong>Lunch</strong>. Instead of 1d6 HP, the Cleric
can remove the <strong>Frightened</strong>, <strong>Fatigued</strong> or
<strong>Poisoned</strong> condition.</p>
<p><strong>C: Signs &amp; Portents.</strong> In a mountain temple,
roadside shrine, or village chapel you may spend 1 Turn in meditation to
gain an divine insight or guidance. You might receive visions containing
pertinent clues -though rarely clear direction.</p>
<p><strong>D: Witch Hunter.</strong> You can smell the foul taint of
necromancers, warlocks, cursed objects, and evil clerics. You are able
to track them as a ranger tracks a dangerous animal.</p>
<p>When in their presence they emit a sooty smoke and reek of sulfur.
Only you can detect these emanations. Once you have laid eyes on such
persons or objects, <strong>Save vs Wisdom</strong> to track them when
they are out of your sight (1 mile range).</p>
<p><strong>CANTICLES</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Banish.</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 20’, T: [sum] undead, D: [dice] Turns</em></p>
<p>Banish [sum] undead of up to [dice] HD. Banished creatures flee the
area and will not harm or make contact with the cleric.</p>
<p>If the cleric’s level exceeds the undead’s HD by 3+ the undead are
destroyed outright.</p>
<p>When used against a mixed group of undead, those with the lowest HD
are affected first.</p>
<p><strong>2. Light</strong></p>
<p><em>R: touch, T: object or creature, D: [dice]x2 hours.</em></p>
<p>Object illuminates as a torch -20’+[dice]x10’ radius. You can choose
the color of the light. Make an attack against a sighted creature to
blind them for [sum] rounds. A failed attack does not consume any MD or
a RIC’s spell.</p>
<p>If you invest 4 [dice] or more this light has all the qualities of
natural sunlight.</p>
<p><strong>3. Ward</strong></p>
<p><em>R: self, T: self +[dice]x5’, D: [dice] Turns</em></p>
<p>A stationary silvery ring appears beneath the cleric who names one
thing that cannot cross it: orcs, undead, projectiles, metal, etc.</p>
<p>For each [dice] invested after the first, expand the affected area by
+5’ in all directions or declare a second monster type/material that
cannot cross your ward.</p>
<p>Creatures with less HD than the [dice] invested in the spell that
attempt to pass your ward are destroyed. Creatures of equal or greater
HD are banished.</p>
<p><strong>4. Heal</strong></p>
<p><em>R: touch T: creature or creatures D: concentration</em></p>
<p>Heal up to [sum] HP of creatures you touch. You may distribute
healing among as many creatures as you would like, as long as the total
HP healed does not exceed [sum] and you maintain concentration. If you
invest 4 [dice] or more, you may instead heal a single target fully.
Alternatively, you can chose to inflict [sum] damage, distributed among
creatures you touch as long as you maintain concentration, or invest 4
[dice] to deal [sum] damage to a creature and force it to Save or lose a
limb.</p>
<p><strong>5. Remove or Cause Fear</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 20’, T: [dice] creatures, D: Instant [Dice] creatures are
purged of fear.</em></p>
<p>Save vs Wisdom to cause fear in [dice] HD worth of creatures. Save
ends.</p>
<p><strong>6. Weal or Woe</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 60’, T: [dice] creatures, D: Instant</em></p>
<p>[Dice] allies gain advantage on their next action, attack, or save.
Alternatively, impose disadvantage on the next actions, attacks, or
saves of [dice] enemies.</p>
<p><strong>7. Hold</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 100’, T: creature, D: [sum] rounds</em></p>
<p>[Dice] HD worth of creatures are paralyzed for [sum] rounds. Save
ends.</p>
<p><strong>8. Silence</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’, T: [dice]x5’ area or creature, D: [sum] rounds</em></p>
<p>Affected area is rendered utterly silent. Spellcasting is not
possible within. Noise from outside the area cannot be heard.</p>
<p>Save vs Wisdom to cast on a creature.</p>
<p><strong>9. Command</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’, T: [dice] HD creature, D: [sum] rounds You shout a
single-word command. </em></p>
<p>Save vs Wisdom.</p>
<p>The command cannot directly cause the target harm, or force them to
commit a directly harmful action. For each [dice] invested, add an
additional word to your command.</p>
<p><strong>10. Striking</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 20’, T: single weapons D: [dice]+1 rounds</em></p>
<p>A weapon becomes enchanted, dealing +1D6 damage and counts as a magic
weapon.</p>
<p><strong>11. Detect invisible</strong></p>
<p><em>R: [sum]x10’, T: self, D: [dice] Turns</em></p>
<p>Invisible creatures or items in range are revealed to the cleric.</p>
<p><strong>12. Spirit Gate</strong></p>
<p><em>R: blast, T: 10’x15’ cone, D: Instant</em></p>
<p>Part the veil between worlds for a split-second. Targets take [sum]
damage and are knocked prone. Save vs Constitution for 1⁄2 damage and
remain standing. All in the cone are deafened for [sum] rounds. If [sum]
is greater than 12, the effect is permanent.</p>
<p><strong>DIVINE ATTENTION</strong> When a Cleric rolls doubles they
draw the attention of a divine being. If they roll triples, add +2 to
the roll. +4 for quadruples.</p>

<h2 id="druid"><strong>DRUID</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> obsidian spear or dagger, pelts
(as light armor), wooden mask to conceal your human nature. You will not
wear metal armor.</p>
<p><strong>A: Iron Guts, Skinchanger, +1 ND</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: The Blood, Animism, +1 ND</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Old Tongue, Vine, +1 ND</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Forest Walker, +1 ND</strong></p>
<p>You gain 1 <strong>Nature Die</strong> (<strong>ND</strong>) per
Druid template. They act like Magic Dice.</p>
<p><strong>A: Iron Guts.</strong> You can eat almost anything and suffer
no ill effects. Rotten fruit, bugs, stinking meat, tree bark, grass and
lichens. As long as it’s not outright poisonous it will function as a
ration for you.</p>
<p><strong>A: Skinchanger.</strong> Learn a new animal form by subduing
a live one with your bear hands, eating one raw that you’ve killed, or
other forms. Start with a random one form (1d8): Bird, Wolf, Cat, Goat,
Donkey, Monkey, Crab, Snake. Unnatural creatures require a <strong>Save
vs. WIS</strong> and a minimum of 4 ND when you become them.</p>
<p>Cast each form as a spell. Equipment not included, size limited by
[dice]. 1 ND - smaller than a person, 2 ND - smaller than a horse, 3 ND
- smaller than a cart, 4 ND - smaller than a house. Gain bonus hit
points = [sum], but lose 1 every hour. When the bonus HP are gone, you
revert back to human form. When you take damage, you can choose which
pool of HP takes it.</p>
<p>Each animal form usually comes with an attack, a buff, a passive and
an ability costing 1HP. You won’t be able to speak.</p>
<p><strong>B: Animism.</strong> You are attuned to the living spirits
all around you in stoic rock, burbling stream, and wolf’s red ripping
mouth. They whisper in your ear, a never quiet babble, always vying for
your attention.</p>
<p>You are sly and wily. When you acquire template A you can make a
<strong>WIS save</strong> to leave a false trail that pursuers will
follow. You can see 30ft in the dark as long as there is starlight (or
equivalent).</p>
<p>With template B you can mimic any sound, and recall any face.</p>
<p>With Template C you can do the spooky head thing like an owl. You
effectively have 360 degree vision. You move in complete silence as long
as you’re not touching the ground.</p>
<p>With template D you can slip free from any bonds or confinement you
are placed in 1/day. Does not work in containers without an exit (sealed
coffin, pocket dimension, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>B: The Blood.</strong> You have advantage on <strong>WIS
saves</strong> to track a wounded creature. You can identify any
creature that you have seen before by tasting it’s blood and estimate
how old the blood is.</p>
<p><strong>C: Vine.</strong> Cast vine seeds which grow up to ten feet
instantly, across any solid surface. Can be used to climb walls, destroy
weak structures, or immobilize an enemy (<strong>Save vs. STR</strong>
to resist, lasts until they succeed on a save on their turnor until they
are freed).</p>
<p><strong>C: Old Tongue.</strong> You speak the secret language of
rocks, trees, and animals. You have advantage on reaction rolls when
speaking to an animal, copse of trees, mushroom colony, or mountain for
the first time. These things can answer questions you may ask assuming
they know what you are talking about, but any knowledge they share will
be from an alien perspective that is hard for humanoids to make sense
of.</p>
<p><strong>D: Forest Walker.</strong> You gain the ability to leave
mystical messages on trees, rocks, ponds, or any other natural unworked
object. Only others with the Forest Walker ability can read these
messages and you must communicate with mental images rather than written
words or runes.</p>
<p>You also gain the ability to step inside a tree to avoid
starvation/thirst/extreme weather or restore your health. It takes 1 day
to regain 1 HP in this way as you draw water and nutrients from the
soil.</p>
<p>When you enter a tree you may exit from another tree as long as you
have line of sight to it from the ground.</p>
<p>Dryads have either the best or worst possible response to you [50/50
odds] when making a reaction roll.</p>
<p><strong>Animal Forms</strong></p>
<p>Bird - Peck (1d4), +2 Defense while flying, Twitter (-1 HP, recruit
nearby birds or be roughly understood by target humanoid)</p>

<p><strong>NOTES ON THE DRUID</strong> The druid is less like a magical
Park Ranger and more like San from Princess Mononoke. You don’t do
“subtle”. You care as little as the average opossum does about
maintaining some notional balance between Civilization and the Wild. You
act impulsively, and with little thought for future consequences.</p>
<p>This is not a free pass to be a jerk at the table. We have real
relationships to maintain with the other people playing this game. Even
our friends have limited tolerance for our bullshit.</p>
<p>This class is an invitation for some over-the- top role-playing and
generally goofy fun. Be open to the idea of the other PCs talking you
out of crazy stunts and holding you back at the last second from doing
impulsive things.</p>
<p>You have a toolkit of strange abilities that are highly situational.
You are a child of the untamed wilderness and possessed by the cold
spirit of Nature.</p>
<p>“Druids love natural spaces. It’s even fair to say that druids feed
on them. They feed on the snow that falls on ancient pines. They feed on
the weevils gnawing on roots. They feed on the hunger in a wolf’s
belly.</p>
<p>Because these things are Natural they are Good, for at least one
definition of “Good”. Nature is red in tooth and claw. Nature is hungry
and rapacious. Nature is self-absorbed. Does a panther care about
anything beyond it’s own well-being? Because these things are Nature,
they are also Druids.</p>
<p>Every druid’s dream in life is to become a giant grizzly bear, fat
and unchallenged.” - goblinpunch.blogspot.com</p>

<h2 id="fey-stalker"><strong>FEY STALKER</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting Gear:</strong> Light Armor, Bow, Arrows (20, 1
slot), Fletchers Kit.</p>
<p><strong>A: Fey Archery, +2 Enchantments, +1 MD</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Inhuman Accuracy, +1 Enchantment +1 MD</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Impossible Shot, +1 Enchantment, +1 MD, +1
To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Meld With Shadow, +4 Enchantments, +1 MD</strong></p>
<p>Gain <strong>+1 Magic Die</strong> (MD) for each Fey Stalker template
you possess, to a maximum of 4. Medium and Heavy Armor affect the MD of
Fey Stalkers like any other spellcaster.</p>
<p><strong>A: Fey Archery.</strong> There is nothing inherently magical
about your bow or the arrows. But you know how to whisper to the
remnants of life still clinging to the wood, bone, and sinew of your
tools, and this allows you to imbue them with powerful enchantments.</p>
<p>Enchantments always destroy the arrow -you need to track your
ammunition. When you fire your bow without using an Enchantment you have
the normal 3-in-6 chance of recovering it at the end of an
encounter.</p>
<p>When you select Template A, roll 1d6 twice and gain the enchantments
listed. Template B, roll 1d8. Template C, roll 1d10. Template D, choose
4 enchantments from the list.</p>
<p>Enchantments either require a to-hit roll, a save from the target, or
just work. The enchantment description will note which.</p>
<p><strong>B: Inhuman Accuracy</strong>. Your arrows appear to twist and
turn in flight with uncanny precision. You ignore the penalty for
shooting into melee combat.</p>
<p><strong>C: Impossible Shot.</strong> Once per encounter, you can make
an impossible shot with a ranged weapon. The attack automatically hits,
provided the target is within 2x the weapon’s listed range. The attack
can bounce around corners, cut a coin in half, or part a single hair on
a target’s head.</p>
<p><strong>D: Meld With Shadow.</strong> Burn MD to meld with darkness
for [dice]+[sum] rounds. MD invested in this ability are automatically
lost for the day. While within dim light or darkness, you can walk on
walls and ceilings. If you remain utterly motionless you automatically
pass any stealth checks.</p>
<p><strong>ENCHANTMENTS</strong></p>
<p>Enchantment Format:</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong></p>
<p><em>R: (range), T: (# of targets), D: (duration)</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Banshee Arrows</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’, T: [dice]x2 creatures, D: 0</em></p>
<p>Screams like a demon in flight and shrieks on impact. Affected
creatures must make a WIS Save or be frightened.</p>
<p><strong>2. Breath of The Dragon Arrow</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’, T: area, D: [dice] rounds x3</em></p>
<p>The arrow trails brightly colored smoke that can, a) fill a
[dice]x10’ square area or, b) a [sum]’ wide, 10’ tall, [dice]x20’ long
wall of smoke.</p>
<p>With 1MD the smoke lightly obscures an area, imposing -2 on ranged
attacks. With 2 MD all attacks are made at -2 to-hit and creatures have
advantage to hide. With 3 or more MD everyone in the affected area is
blinded, except the fey stalker or any creature with magic or wizard
vision.</p>
<p><strong>3. Chaos Arrow</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’, T: [dice] creatures, D: 0</em></p>
<p>Affected creatures takes [dice]+[sum] damage and twitch-dances
[sum]x5’ in a random direction. WIS Save for 1⁄2 damage and to avoid
being moved.</p>
<p><strong>4. Sap Arrow</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’, T: [dice] x5’ area, D: [sum] rounds</em></p>
<p>DEX Save to avoid. Affected creatures are splattered with clinging
sap. They are considered to be encumbered. If multiple creatures are
affected they must move as a group, and save as a single creature.</p>
<p><strong>5. Acid Arrow</strong></p>
<p>*R: 50”, T: creature or object, D: 08</p>
<p>Make a ranged attack roll. Target takes [dice]+[sum] damage, as well
as [sum] ongoing damage for [dice] rounds. If fired as a wooden wall,
door, or floor the arrow will create a hole in 1 Turn big enough for
medium and smaller creatures to pass through. Does not work on stone or
metal.</p>
<p><strong>6. Fox-Eared Arrow</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’, T: 20’ area, D: [sum] rounds</em></p>
<p>The Fey Stalker can hear all sounds within 20’ of the arrow as if
they were being made directly next to them.</p>
<p><strong>7. Magpie Arrow</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’, T: object or person, D: 0</em></p>
<p>The arrow swaps places with the target, allowing the Fey Stalker to
teleport objects into their hand.</p>
<p>1 MD: target an object no larger than a gold coin or iron key.</p>
<p>2MD: target an object that occupies no more than 1 Item Slot (a hat,
a sword, etc.)</p>
<p>3 MD: target an object that is equivalent to a medium sized creature
or smaller.</p>
<p>4 MD: target an object the size of a ogre or wagon.</p>
<p><strong>8 Flesh-to-Stone Arrow</strong></p>

<strong>paralyzed</strong>. Apply a -[dice] modifier to the
<strong>save</strong>.</p>

<p><em>R: 50’, T: creature, D: [sum] rounds</em></p>
<p>Fill [dice] adjacent 10’ cubes with a blur of spectral arrows that
hum like angry bees and inflict [sum] damage to anyone who passing
through the area. DEX Save for 1⁄2.</p>
<p>The area is considered hazardous terrain.</p>
<p><strong>10. Entangling Arrow</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’, T: area, D: [dice]+[sum] rounds</em></p>
<p>Grasping bramble erupt in a [dice]x10’ square. These plants turn the
ground in the area into hazardous terrain that inflicts [sum] damage on
anyone restrained or passing through it.</p>
<p>Creatures in the area must Save vs STR or be restrained by the
entangling vines. Save ends.</p>
<p><strong>11. Displacer Arrow</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 75’ T: varies, D: 0</em></p>
<p>Make a ranged attack roll. Target takes 1d6+STR damage.</p>
<p>Each MD invested in this spell allow you to fire an additional arrow
at the same target with a stacking +2 to hit, or at a new target with no
additional bonus.</p>
<p><strong>12. Blink Arrow</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’, T; area, D: 0</em></p>
<p>Fire an arrow at an area you can see. The arrow trails an arcane
umbilical that is anchored to your bow. When the arrow arrives, you are
whisked across the intervening space.</p>
<p>Watch out for pillars and plumes of fire.</p>

<li><p>You are stalked by the Wild Hunt.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTES ON THE FEY STALKER</strong></p>
<p>You’re not quite the sharpshooter or tracker that the Hunter is, but
your spells bring a lot of utility to a fight. Battlefield control is
your focus.</p>
<p>Only two of your enchantments are specifically offensive, and Acid
Arrow is situationally useful outside of combat. Flesh-to-Stone has a
very limited window of effectiveness. It is primarily intended to let
you escape from powerful monsters you should have avoided in the first
place.</p>
<h2 id="gun-priest"><strong>GUN PRIEST</strong></h2>
<p>Requirement: You are a dwarf.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> witchlock arquebux (2 slots),
dagger (1/3 slot), leather armor, cartridge box &amp; hayago (1
slot).</p>
<p><strong>A: Gear Empathy, Word of Law, +1 MD, +2 Bullet Prayers (roll
1d6)</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Read Stone, Roots of The Mountain, +1 MD, +1 Bullet Prayer
(1d8)</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Powder Sprite, Smoldering, +1 MD, +1 Bullet Prayer (1d10),
+1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Arcanum, Dead Eye, +1 MD, +4 Bullet Prayers</strong></p>
<p>You are a dwarf. You gain <strong>+2 HP</strong> with template A
&amp; C. You gain <strong>+1 to Find Hidden Things</strong> (doors,
pressure-plates, tripwires, etc.) with template B &amp; D.</p>
<p><strong>A: Gear Empathy.</strong> Attuned to arcane machinery and
gearworks, Dwarvish Gun Priests understand machines better than they do
people. You gain +2 to repair, modify, or sabotage mundane machines.</p>
<p><strong>A: Word of Law.</strong> The invisible laws that bind reality
are as words on the page to the Gun Priest. You can speak with authority
when trying to convince others. Gain <strong>Advantage</strong> on Saves
for commanding others.</p>
<p><strong>B: Read Stone.</strong> You know when all the traps &amp;
secret doors in a dungeon level have been found.</p>
<p><strong>B: Roots of The Mountain.</strong> As long as one foot is
planted firmly on the ground you have advantage on saves to resist being
knocked prone, shoved, or otherwise moved.</p>
<p>You also gain <strong>+2</strong> on rolls to perform the following
<strong>combat maneuvers</strong>: grapple, shield bash, trip.</p>
<p><strong>C: Powder Sprite.</strong> Recruit a powder sprite–a familiar
which can reload your arquebux (cancelling the reload time), be consumed
for +1 MD (non-recoverable, like a scroll), or be sacrificed as a
magical grenade (2d6 to all in 10’ area, <strong>DEX save</strong> for
half).</p>
<p>You may summon a new powder sprite after a <strong>Good Night’s
Rest</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>C: Smoldering.</strong> If you make a charge attack with your
arquebux and kill your target, enemies who can see the attack must make
a Morale test. You don’t have to light your beard on fire and scream but
it helps.</p>
<p><strong>D: Arcanum.</strong> You can create arcanum; limited use
magical devises using bits of ancient technology salvaged while
adventuring. You require a wizard’s sanctum. It takes 2 Item Slots worth
of salvaged tech to create 1 arcanum.</p>
<p>The time and cost involves are the same as creating a scroll, but
they occupy 1 Item Slot, have 1d3 MD worth of charges, and their effect
is determined randomly by rolling on the Random Spells table (see
<strong>Magic and Spells</strong>). For an addition 150gp you can work
out how to make the arcanum replicate a specific spell effect that you
already know, rather than rolling for it randomly.</p>
<p>Arcanum are rendered inert after their MD has been used up and cannot
be repurposed. Most tend to crumble into dust. MD are never recovered on
a 4-6.</p>
<p><strong>D: Dead Eye.</strong> Once per session, you can fire a single
shot and declare it to have hit. Roll 1d6:</p>
<p>1–3: Regular damage and target is knocked prone.</p>
<p>4–6: Critical hit.</p>
<p><strong>THE WITCHLOCK ARQUEBUX</strong></p>
<p>The witchlock arquebux is a device unique to gun priests.</p>
<p>Dwarfs take the Principia Arcana explanation of spells being magic
bullets that wizards load into their heads and fire from their mind-guns
literally. Not possessing meat-brains the way that other mortal species
do, dwarven craftsmen applied their not inconsiderable skill to the
problem and developed the basic pattern of the occultum reactive
accelerator and the witchlock firing mechanism.</p>
<p>Irredeemably pragmatic as a species, the first arquebuxes were purely
functional devices for deploying spells. Over time however the gun
priests who crafted them began to impart their own decorative flare -a
practice that has caused much scowling and muttered disapproval from the
Council of Forge Masters.</p>
<p>Intricately decorated and master-crafted, each arquebux is a unique
work of art. Crafted as part of the final rituals to become a sanctioned
Journeyman of the Crucible. As no two arquebux’s are the same, one might
use a break-action witchlock design to load spell-cartridges, while
others might be lever- action, breach-loading, or employ a locking
bolt.</p>
<p><strong>WITCHLOCK ARQUEBUX</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slots:</strong> 1, <strong>Hands:</strong> 2,
<strong>Notes:</strong> 1 round to reload.</p>
<p>All arquebuxes share the same core components:</p>
<p><strong>Witchlock.</strong> Consisting of a firing mechanism, the
“dog”, a cold iron firing pin, and a witch-stone sparking pan.</p>
<p><strong>Occultum Reactive Accelerator.</strong> Alternating rings of
occultum and brass wrapped in copper wire, fitted with a protective
sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Accumulator.</strong> A passive devise that draws
ambient magic radiation into a canister resembling a small hand-cranked
coffee grinder.</p>
<p><strong>Coronal Discharge Unit.</strong> When an arquebux is fired,
dangerous sympathetic magical vibrations can accumulate within the
accelerator. The CaD is designed to mitigate this danger.</p>
<p><strong>Axehead.</strong> CaD technology is far from perfected so
sometimes cold steel is your go-to problem solving tool. Treat as a
greataxe in melee (1d12, knock target prone on a critical hit).</p>
<p><strong>WITCHLOCK AMMUNITION</strong> Gun Priests carry a bulky
cartridge box that holds 12 charges, called a hayago. Each hayago holds
an amorphous blob of spell matter.</p>
<p>The cartridge box is also an enchantment engraver. The gun priest
sets the selector nobs for the <strong>Bullet Prayer</strong> they
desire, feeds in a punch-card, and work a small crank.</p>
<p>They can then retrieve, load, and fire the <strong>Bullet
Prayer</strong>they selected.</p>
<p>A powder sprite greatly speeds the process (allowing the Arquebux to
be loaded and fired in the same round).</p>
<p><strong>1. Battering Beam</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 100’ T: creature or object D: concentration</em></p>
<p>A beam of force strikes a target you can see, pushing them backwards.
Target must Save vs Strength or be pushed away from you 10’ per round.
Very large creatures only move 5’ per round. The beam inflicts a -[dice]
penalty to the save. Inflict [dice] x d6 damage each round to stationary
objects. If you invest 3 [dice] or more, creatures that fail their save
are knocked prone.</p>
<p>Each round you maintain concentration increases the -[dice] modifier
to the STR saves by 1, making it more difficult. If the target cannot
move backwards, it takes 1d6, +1/per round, bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p><strong>2. Sleep Gas</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50ft, T: [sum] HD of creatures D: Varies</em></p>
<p>Target falls into a magical slumber, and can’t be awoken by anything
less vigorous than a slap. WIS Save negates. Non-alert, unaware targets
do not get a save. If [sum] is at least x4 the creature’s HD, the
duration becomes permanent (until slapped). Creature no longer needs to
eat or drink while sleeping.</p>
<p>Invest 3 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes
permanent, and you set the only condition that will cause the creature
to awake (the sunrise before the apocalypse, true love’s kiss, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>3. Grease Bomb</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50ft, T: object, surface, D: [dice]x2 rounds</em></p>
<p>Can be shot directly at a creature or a 10’ x 10’ x [dice] surface.
Save vs Dexterity or drop held objects and fall prone.</p>
<p><strong>4. Knock-Knock</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50ft, T: [dice] objects, D: 0</em></p>
<p>Object is opened. Doors explode, locks are broken, shackles are bent
open, belts come undone. If target is an armored creature, CON save or
armor falls off. If target is an unarmored creature, CON save or vomit
for 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p><strong>5. Negasonic Ray</strong></p>
<p><em>R: [dice]x20‘ cone T: area D: concentration</em></p>
<p>Rippling rings of purple light pour from the barrel of your witchlock
arquebux. All sounds are cancelled within the area of this spell.
Creatures are deafened until the spell ends or they leave the spell’s
area.</p>
<p><strong>6. Immobilizing Gel</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’, T: [dice] x10’ area, D: 0</em></p>
<p>The target area is filled with dense ooze. When fired in a confined
space (doorway, narrow corridor, between two pillars) creatures in the
area are immobilized. Save vs DEX to avoid, prone creatures
automatically fail. STR Save to escape.</p>
<p>In open spaces the gel creates an area of difficult terrain. Movement
rates are halved, creatures in the affected area attack with
disadvantage, and attacks against them are made with advantage.</p>
<p>The gel inflicts 1d4 acid damage per round.</p>
<p><strong>7. Ultra-lucent Paint</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: creature or object D: [sum] hours</em></p>
<p>Creatures get a DEX Save to avoid. You splatter the target in bright
octarine paint, leaving a mark the size of an apple. The mark is visible
through fog, smoke, or total darkness, up to [dice] miles away.</p>
<p>It is also visible through solid barriers, such as stone walls, up to
10’ thick. The paint drips off and marks the ground below the target.
Unless bandaged or swabbed, the paint will leave a faint trail behind
the target.</p>
<p>Attacks against the target are made with advantage.</p>
<p><strong>8. Wending Bolt</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 200’ T: creature D: 0</em></p>
<p>Target takes [dice]+[sum] damage. DEX Save for 1⁄2. You do not need
to see the target, but you do need to know their approximate location
(within 10’), and there must be a clear path a bolt could trace to reach
them. The path can be as convoluted as required. The bolt can pass
through gaps as small as a fist.</p>
<p>Makes shooting into melee less terrible.</p>
<p><strong>9. Alter Local Gravity</strong></p>
<p>*R: 50’ T: [sum]x5’ squares D: [sum] rounds8</p>
<p>Only works indoors, in an area with a solid roof no more than 50’
high. An area that you specify has its gravity altered to a) an angle
that you specify (90 degrees left, 180 degrees up), or b) a lower
strength that you specify (50%, 0%) for the duration of the spell.</p>
<p>The spell’s effect takes place gradually, giving creatures a chance
to Save vs Dexterity to hang on to something. Creatures take fall damage
as normal. In lower gravity, you can jump proportionately higher and
farther, but virtually any action requires a DEX Save.</p>
<p><strong>10. Displacer Beast Blast</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’ T: creatures D: [dice] rounds</em></p>
<p>A spell-effect that exists in multiple places at once. A creature
takes [sum] damage on their turn for [dice] rounds. If this kills them,
they explode for [sum] damage to all in 10’. DEX Save for 1⁄2. If this
would kill an adjacent creature, they explode as well.</p>
<p><strong>EMBLEM BULLET PRAYERS</strong></p>
<p><strong>11. Prismatic Eruption</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 200ft, T: [dice] creatures or objects, D: 0</em></p>
<p>An air-burst spell that showers an area with multi-colored beams of
magic. Target suffers a different effect depending on which color
strikes the target. <strong>Roll 1d10</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>GUN PRIEST NOTES</strong></p>
<p>You cast spells slowly for the first 3 levels but you also never run
out of MD. You might also explode as you accumulate instability
dice.</p>
<p>Gun Priests bring a lot of dungeoneering skills to a party with gear
empathy and read stone. With roots of the mountain you are an excellent
support fighter, setting teammates up for devastating attacks.</p>
<p>The ability to create random, limited use, magical item with master
artificer is fun. It’s also a way to bleed PCs of gold in return for
magic items.</p>
<p><strong>MISFIRES</strong> Gun Priests are not subtle. When a
witchlock arquebux is fired it is always accompanied by a ring of smoke,
an ear-shattering crack, and a discharge of purple light as the coronal
discharge unit attempts to bleed off residual arcane energy.</p>
<p>Despite the best efforts of the Improbability Forge’s best craftsmen,
a CaD capable of bleeding off 100% of residual sympathetic magical
vibrations has not yet been achieved.</p>
<p>When an arquebux is fired, the MD automatically return to the gun
priest’s pool. They also accumulate an Instability Die (ID). Each time a
spell is fired the PC also rolls their ID. ID do not count towards the
results of a spell, but do count towards misfires. Different colored
dice are recommended.</p>
<p>A gun priest may bleed off 1d6 ID during Lunch, and all ID after a
Good Night’s Rest. The process involves meditation, muttering sutras,
and power-tools.</p>

<p><strong>B: The Path of Water, Qi Recovery, +1 HP, +1QD</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Arrow Frog Hallucination Stance, +1QD, +1HP, +1
To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Crane Steps Softly Through Spring Reeds, +1 HP,
+1QD</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Martial Arts.</strong> Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 +STR
damage &amp; count as melee weapons.</p>
<p><strong>A: Qi Training.</strong> Qi dice (QD) are d6s and work like
magic dice. Qi Dice are spent to activate Qigong Techniques. For each
Monk template, your learn a new Qi technique. Select one from the
options presented below at the appropriate template level. Some Monks
may discover additional techniques in remote temples or studying with
hidden masters.</p>
<p>For every QD that you invest in a martial arts attack, you can
inflict an additional 1d6 damage to your target <strong>or</strong> deal
1d6 damage to another foe that is in range <strong>or</strong> unleash a
Qigong technique (on top of your regualr damage). Investing too much is
dangerous.</p>
<p>If you invest 3QD make a <strong>Save vs Constitution</strong> or
suffer a level of <strong>fatigue</strong>.</p>
<p>At 4QD you automatically suffer 2 levels of
<strong>fatigue</strong></p>
<p>Qi dice are restored after a <strong>Good Night’s Rest</strong>. If
you do not get a good night’s rest or your rest is disrupted by a hazard
or combat, make a <strong>WIS save</strong> for each QD to recover it
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>B: The Path of the Water.</strong> While you are unarmored
and not wielding a shield, add both your WIS and DEX Bonus to AC.</p>
<p><strong>B: Qi Recovery.</strong> During <strong>Lunch</strong>,
<strong>Save vs WIS</strong> to remove one level of
<strong>Fatigue</strong> (in addition to regualr fatigue recovery) or
<strong>save vs WIS</strong> to recover a lost QD.</p>
<p><strong>C: Arrow Frog Hallucination Stance.</strong> When an attack
allows a save for 1⁄2 damage, you instead take no damage.</p>
<p><strong>D: Crane Steps Softly Through Spring Reeds.</strong> Your
movement speed is doubled. You gain the ability to move along vertical
surfaces, water, and the spear-tips of your enemies. You ignore pressure
plates. You must end your movement on solid ground.</p>
<p><strong>QIGONG TECHNIQUES</strong></p>
<p>Monks express fundamental truths of Creation through violence and the
merciless reforging of their own inner spirit -called Qi. Monks call
these truths “qigong.” New truths are revealed with each Monk template
that you possess.</p>
<p><strong>A: Open Hand Bell Strike</strong></p>
<p><em>R: melee touch, T: creature, D: instant</em></p>
<p>Only effective against foes of equal or lower HD than you. Creature
makes a CON Save, with a -[dice] penalty or be stunned until the end of
your next turn.</p>
<p>At 2 [dice] the creature is incapacitated. At 3 [dice] they are
paralyzed. At 4+ [dice] the creature dies.</p>
<p><strong>A: Throw The Ox-Cart</strong></p>
<p><em>R: melee touch, T: creature, D: instant</em></p>
<p>Target is knocked back [dice] x 15’ in a direction of your choice. If
the target comes into contact with a solid surface, they smash through
it and take [sum] damage.</p>
<p><strong>B: Gentle Repose Of The Fallen Leaf</strong></p>
<p><em>R: melee touch T: self D: instant</em></p>
<p>Reduce fall damage by [sum]. You float gently to the ground (possibly
alarmingly late) or at least impact in a more survivable way.</p>
<p><strong>B: Rain Parts For The Wise</strong></p>
<p><em>R: self, T: attacker, D: instant</em></p>
<p>This technique can be used as a reaction. Reduce the damage of an
attack by [dice]+[sum]. If this reduces the damage to 0, a target of
your choosing is hit by the attack instead.</p>
<p><strong>C: Quivering Palm Parts The Waters</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 15’ cone, T: varies, D: instant</em></p>
<p>Fists made of blue Qi explode from your open palms. Creatures in a
15’ cone take [sum] damage. Save vs Dexterity for 1⁄2 damage.</p>
<p><strong>C: Empty Palm Vanquishes The Wicked</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 50’, T: object, D: [sum] rounds</em></p>
<p>Manifest a gigantic hand made of blue Qi energy. The hand can be used
to strike anyone within range for [sum] damage, or it can do anything
else a giant hand could do. Run around on its fingers, hold things,
grapple, etc. It has a STR of +[dice]x2 and [sum] HP.</p>
<p><strong>D: Clear Sky, White Lightning</strong></p>
<p><em>R: melee touch, T: [dice] creature, D: instant</em></p>
<p>Charge your attack with lightning inflicting [sum] lightning damage.
Strike an additional targets within 30’ with arcing lightning inflicting
[sum]-5 damage for each additional Qi Die invested.</p>
<p><strong>DOUBT</strong></p>
<p>A monk’s path is one of constant training, meditation, and study.</p>
<p>When a Monk rolls doubles on their Qi Dice they suffer doubt and
momentarily question if they walk the true path of Enlightenment.</p>
<p>The doubles you rolled (1’s, 2’s, 3’s, etc.) determine the
consequences of your doubt.</p>

<h2 id="sorcerer"><strong>SORCERER</strong></h2>
<p>Wizards studied to gain power, Warlocks borrow power. A Sorcerer’s
power is their own.</p>
<p>They have turned their souls inward and built a pyre in their hearts.
They are more real than the rest of the world. Rare, because their arts
cannot be taught, and because they frequently explode. Intolerable,
because they cannot abide servitude or obedience. Powerful, because the
world reshapes itself to their whims. Something within a sorcerer allows
them to touch and alter the very fabric of Creation and they are all
absolutely nuts.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> Outlandish Costume</p>
<p><strong>A: Soul Casting, +1 SD</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Billowing Robes, +1 SD</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Soul Vision, +1 SD</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Magic Ward, +1 SD</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Soul Casting.</strong> You alter the world through sheer
force of will. You need no charms, no runes, no spells, no incantations.
Reality is yours to command.</p>
<p>You change the world using your Sorcerer Dice (SD). You gain +1 SD
(1d6) per Sorcerer template to a maximum of 4 SD. Each time you use one
of the abilities below, invest any number of your SD. The [sum] of the
SD rolled, as well as the number of [dice] invested, may affect the
result.</p>
<p>SD can be used any number of times per day. Unlike a wizard’s MD,
they always return to your pool. However, each time your SD returns to
your pool you accrue 1 Instability Die (ID, 1d6). You always roll all
your ID when you use your sorcerous powers. These dice do not count
towards the [sum] or [dice] of any given power, but they do count
towards doubles, triples, and quadruples. Use different colored
dice.</p>
<p>Ex.: Ziwilgo the Sorcerer, level 2, has 2 SD to invest. She wishes to
Harm a target and invests both SD. She has used two other sorcerous
effects today, so adds +2 ID. Only the 2 SD count towards the [dice] and
[sum] of the spell, but all four dice are counted for the purposes of
Calamities (doubles, triples, and quadruples).</p>
<p>Sorcerers don’t run out of steam. They have the opposite problem.
Like an overcharged locomotive, they sometimes explode.</p>
<p>Medium and Heavy Armor reduce the number of available SD, like MD for
spellcasters.</p>
<p><strong>SORCEROUS POWERS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Harm.</strong> Deal [sum]+[dice] damage to one target
creature or object you can see. Creatures can make a DEX save for 1⁄2
damage. Flavor however you’d like: lightning bolts, beams of light,
grasping hands from the underworld.</p>
<p>+1 ID per additional target.</p>
<p><strong>Alter.</strong> Make a declarative statement affecting one
creature or object you can see. The statement is true for [dice] rounds.
The statement cannot cause damage directly (use Harm), move a creature
or object, or create new objects or effects (use Create). Creatures and
magical objects can make a WIS save to avoid being altered.</p>
<p>E.g. “This door does not exist.” You can walk through the space the
door formerly occupied.</p>
<p>“The dragon is now a mole.” The dragon still has all its original
abilities and HP, but it might be easier to hit. “The dragon is made of
paper.” The dragon is now made of paper for [dice] rounds. If you set it
on fire with a torch, it will take extra damage.</p>
<p>+1 SD per additional target.</p>
<p>+1 SD to affect an area the size of a wagon.</p>
<p>+2 SD to affect an area the size of a cottage.</p>
<p>+3 SD to affect an area the size of a village.</p>
<p>+1 SD to make the effect last for [dice] minutes.</p>
<p>+2 SD to make the effect last for [dice] hours.</p>
<p>+3 SD to make the effect last for [dice] days.</p>
<p><strong>Create.</strong> Create something, a creature or object.
Creations exists for [dice] rounds, are person- sized or smaller, and
have 2HD. They cannot deal damage.</p>
<p>You can create objects with magical effects (flying carpets,
invisibility cloaks), but created objects cannot deal magical damage
(you can make a regular sword but not a +10 vorpal sword of fire) or
provide permanent effects (healing potions only heal for the duration
listed, rings of permanent stat gain only work for the duration). You
can make a sword that looks like a +10 vorpal sword of fire though.</p>
<p>+1 SD per additional object or creature created.</p>
<p>+1 SD to create a magical or sufficiently weird object.</p>
<p>+2 SD to create a creature of up to +4 HD.</p>
<p>+1 SD to create an object the size of a wagon.</p>
<p>+2 SD to create an object the size of a cottage.</p>
<p>+3 SD to create an object the size of a village.</p>
<p>+1 SD to make the creature or object last for [dice] minutes.</p>
<p>+2 SD to make the creature or object last for [dice] hours.</p>
<p>+3 SD to make the creature or object last for [dice] days.</p>
<p><strong>B: Billowing Robes.</strong> If you are wearing an outlandish
costume worth at least 10 gp, your armor counts as Leather.</p>
<p>If you are wearing an outlandish costume worth at least 100 gp, your
armor counts as Chain.</p>
<p>If you are wearing an outlandish costume worth at least 1,000 gp,
your armor counts as Plate.</p>
<p><strong>C: Soul Vision.</strong> You can see the souls of living
creatures. This allows you to guess the approximate location of
invisible creatures. You can also immediately tell if a person is
possessed, undead, protected by the Authority, or a spellcaster.</p>
<p>The price for this gift is your connection to others. You permanently
lose 1d2 Wisdom (as the constant scrutiny of souls warps your mind) or
1d2 Charisma (as you become callous and jaded).</p>
<p><strong>D: Magic Ward.</strong> Reduce all incoming magic damage by
2. Does not apply to self-inflicted damage. Once per day, negate the
effects of a spell that targets you. Does not apply to spells generated
by Calamities.</p>

<h2 id="summoner"><strong>SUMMONER</strong></h2>
<p>Taken from: <a href="https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/05/osr-class-summoner-20.html" class="uri">https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/05/osr-class-summoner-20.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment</strong>: 2 sets of mundane robes,
dagger</p>
<p><strong>A: +1 SD, +2 Entities, Summoning</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: +1 SD, +1 Entity, Powerful Hold</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: +1 SD, +1 Entity, Soul Vision</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: +1 SD, Master Summoner, Iron Will</strong></p>
<p>You gain +1 Summoning Die for each Summoner template you possess, to
a maximum of 4.</p>
<p><strong>A: Summoning.</strong> There are 99, and only 99,
<strong>Entities</strong> that can be summoned. Each has a name, a
description, and a list of abilities. They are sentient, but their minds
may work in strange ways. Summon an Entity by rolling your Summoning
Dice. Dice return to your pool and can be used again on a 1-3, but are
exhausted for the day on a 4-6. On doubles, a Mishap occurs. On triples,
a Doom occurs.</p>
<p>You can only summon an Entity once per day. You can summon an entity
for [sum] hours before it vanishes, possibly to serve another master. It
takes one round to summon an Entity. You must be able to speak and you
cannot be distracted.</p>
<p>You require its true name and a description of the mental acts
required to call it to you. Seek ancient scrolls, temples, and cults to
find entities to summon. Unlike Wizard spells, there are no limits on
the number of <strong>Entities’ true names</strong> a summoner can find
and commit to memory. You can use the same instructional scroll to
create an entire cult. However, as only 99 entities exist in Creation,
most Summoners guard their knowledge jealously to avoid sharing
power.</p>
<p>Entities are not angels nor demons nor elementals, according to the
Summoners. Any similarities are purely coincidental, just as both silver
and steel can be polished to the same hue.</p>
<p><strong>B: Powerful Hold.</strong> Chose one entity you know how to
summon. Instead of [sum] hours, the entity is summoned for [sum]x2
hours. Whenever you gain a level, you may change which entity this
ability applies to.</p>
<p><strong>C: Soul Vision.</strong> You can see the souls of living
creatures. This allows you to guess the approximate location of
invisible creatures. You can also immediately tell if a person is
possessed, undead, or a spellcaster. The price for this gift is your
connection to others. You permanently lose 1d6 Wisdom (as the constant
scrutiny of souls warps your mind) or 1d6 Charisma (as you become
callous and jaded).</p>
<p><strong>D: Master Summoner.</strong> Roll for 2 additional Entities.
Alternatively, name an Entity you already control. For as long as you
live, the Entity that you name will always remain with you. If [sum] or
[dice] are required, use 2d6. This does not deplete your SD or cause
Mishaps. You do not need to roll to summon it.</p>
<p><strong>D: Iron Will.</strong> You can control the results of your
summoning through your iron will. <strong>Save vs WIS</strong> to change
the result of one of your rolled SD by one point. This can be used to
increase the effect of your summoning or avoid a
<strong>Mishap</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMONER MISHAPS</strong> 1. Summon Dice only return to your
pool on a 1-2 for the next 24hrs 2. Take 1d6 damage 3. Mute and Blind
1d6 rounds 4. Agony 1d6 rounds 5. Summon has a 1-in-6 chance of
vanishing each hour after being summoned 6. Summon is not under your
control. Will pursue its own agenda for the duration of the summon. May
take on a different form.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMONER DOOMS</strong> 1. Vanish for 1d6 hours to a strange
world of blinding light and geometric shapes made of clay. Perform
strange acts under the light of a thousand stars. 2. Vanish for 3d6
hours, as above. Return with 0 HP. 3. Vanish permanently.</p>
<h2 id="swordcaster"><strong>SWORDCASTER</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment.</strong> A number of swords equal to the
number of hands you have, jug of wine, a dramatically tattered
cloak.</p>
<p><strong>A: Blade Barrier, Hands Clasped</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Steely Gaze, +1 SD</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Size Matters, +1 SD, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Swordspell, +2 SD</strong></p>
<p>Beginning with template B you begin to accrue Sword Dice (SD).
Initially they only buff blade barrier/strike but pay dividends with
template D. SD may be combined with normal magic dice (MD).</p>
<p>Swordcaster abilities use the following notation:</p>
<p>[Sum] = sum of Sword Dice results.</p>
<p>[Dice] = number of Sword Dice rolled.</p>
<p>[Swords] = number of swords you control or invest in an ability.
(Hands + available SD.)</p>
<p><strong>A: Blade Barrier.</strong> For each hand that you possess and
every Sword Die currently in your pool, a 1-handed sword orbits your
body. They rise and fall as you move and will wobble if jostled, but
always return to an upright, point-downward, position. For each sword
you have floating around your body you gain +1 AC.</p>
<p><strong>Blade Strike.</strong> You may attack normally as if your
swords were a ranged (DEX) weapon, firing suddenly from their place at
your side to lash out and stab an enemy.</p>
<p>The range of this attack is 20 feet for each Swordcaster template
that you possess. On a hit, the sword inflicts normal damage for it’s
type (1d8, Arms &amp; Armor, RELIC page 6) and is embedded within the
target until the end of your next turn when it vanishes and reappears in
its normal orbit around your body.</p>
<p>For every additional sword that you invest in this type of attack
your gain a stacking +1 bonus to-hit and +2 damage.</p>
<p>Your AC is reduced by [swords] on the round that you attack and until
the end of your next turn (2 rounds total). It is your responsibility to
track this, not the Referee’s.</p>
<p>Swords that miss their target fly off into the distance or embed
themselves in walls and furniture. They still magically reappear at your
side at the end of your next turn.</p>
<p><strong>A: Hands Clasped.</strong> Your hands are bound. Iron
shackles, mummified in cloth, shoved into a jar; it matters not how,
only that you cannot remove your hands from this state, or you will lose
the ability to swordcast. Your feet work as well as hands for most
tasks, and your bound hands may still be used to grapple, hug, or
otherwise encircle someone.</p>
<p>You cannot wear armor.</p>
<p>When you stand in place you begin to float a foot off the ground but
to move across the ground you must use your feet. For now.</p>
<p>You can slowly (1/4 Move) float straight up/ down 5ft for each
swordcaster template that you possess. You only move horizontally in a
stiff wind.</p>
<p><strong>B: Steely Gaze.</strong> When you lock eyes with someone,
they fall under the effect of a hold person spell. WIS Save to end.
However, while they are under the effects of hold person (paralyzed). So
are you. You can end the effect at any time. Undead and Creatures of 4HD
or greater are unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>C: Size Matters.</strong> You may float a 2-handed sword
around you in place of two 1-handed swords (1d12 damage, Arms &amp;
Armor).</p>
<p>2-handed swords only grant you +1 AC each. The more 2-handed swords
you deign to wield, the easier you will be to hit.</p>
<p><strong>D: Swordspell.</strong> From on high, a sword god calls. Or
maybe a god of swords. Or perhaps the sword of a god. It matters not!
They offer patronage which you eagerly accept.</p>
<p>For each sword that you control, you may inscribe a Swordspell into
it from the following list. While that sword is floating around you, you
may use its Swordspell.</p>
<p>Swordspells cannot be swapped out. Meaning most people will only ever
have 6 spells. An argument could be made for a Tiefling’s prehensile
tail granting them 7.</p>
<p>Swords that you own in excess of the number you are able to float
around your body are just mundane blades. They cannot be used to store
additional swordspells.</p>
<p><strong>SWORDCASTER SPELLS</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Searing Swords</strong></p>
<p>Make a normal blade strike attack. On a hit the blade glows with
white hot intensity inflicting [sum] fire damage and causing the target
to ignite. Target creature may attempt a CON Save to tamp out the
flames. A failed save inflicts 1d6 fire damage/round but does not impede
their ability to move or attack.</p>
<p><strong>2. Petrifying Blades</strong></p>
<p>Creatures with your swords embedded in them have their movement
reduced to 0 until the blades return to their orbit around you.</p>
<p><strong>3. Recall Swords</strong></p>
<p>Up to [dice] swords embedded in creatures pull back to you, dealing
[sum] damage to the creatures they were stuck in.</p>
<p><strong>4. Wall of Swords</strong></p>
<p>[swords] spin around you in melee range dealing [sum] + [dice]
damage. DEX Save for half damage.</p>
<p><strong>5. Bladed Wings</strong></p>
<p>Gain a fly speed equal to [swords]<em>10, and can float up to
[sum]</em>10 feet off the ground. [Dice] rounds duration.</p>
<p><strong>6. Fracture Sword</strong></p>
<p>A sword ascends vertically to a dramatic heigh then embeds itself
with a peel of thunder into the floor/ground inflicting [sum] damage in
a [dice] *5ft radius. Dex Save for half damage.</p>
<p><strong>7.Counter Strike</strong></p>
<p>Once per round as a free action, when you are hit in melee combat you
may counter-attack dealing [sum] damage and the attacker is pushed up to
[dice]*5ft away in any direction.</p>
<p><strong>8. Swords of the Dead</strong></p>
<p>[Dice] enemies that die on your blades reanimate and wield your
swords as weapons. They last for [sum] Turns.</p>
<p><strong>9. Fractal Bladebeam</strong></p>
<p>Make a normal blade strike attack. A beam of coherent light blasts
forth from [dice] swords dealing [sum] +2 damage to the target. If that
enemy already has one of your swords embedded within it they take x2
damage.</p>
<p>The beam may bounce [dice] times until you miss, dealing [sum] +2
damage each bounce.</p>
<p><strong>10. Avatar of Swords</strong></p>
<p>You bond with your floating swords, and become a [dice]-handed sword
that deals [sum] + [swords] damage for [dice] rounds.</p>
<p><strong>SWORDCASTER MISHAPS</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The two MD that rolled doubles are expended.</p></li>
<li><p>You take half of all damage from swords embedded in targets until
your next turn.</p></li>
<li><p>You are stunned for [swords] rounds.</p></li>
<li><p>Gain [dice] levels of fatigue.</p></li>
<li><p>A random swordspell casts at a random target in sight. [dice]
applied are equal to [swords]. (Assuming you have them.)</p></li>
<li><p>A random sword fractures. Take 1d8 slashing damage.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>DOOM OF THE SWORDCASTER</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Your swords are frenzied and attack the nearest creature for
[swords] rounds. This includes you.</p></li>
<li><p>Your swords turn inward on you, you take [swords] *1d8
damage.</p></li>
<li><p>Your swords all return to you, swirl around your body, and impale
you for [swords] *2D8. IF you are reduced to 0HP or below, the swords
shatter, inflicting 3D6 damage to all creatures in a 20’ radius. DEX
Save for half.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTES ON THE SWORDCASTER</strong></p>
<p>The balance between gaining protection from your swords and
sacrificing that protection to inflict damage is interesting and in
keeping with the push-your-luck nature of Adventure games.</p>
<p>You lose swords as you lose magic dice and though you will always
have the equivalent of leather armor you can become quite squishy as the
adventuring day wears on.</p>
<p>Some spells can invest more than one sword, implying that a sword
with one spell inscribed on it can still be part of a different swords
spell effect. Tracking which spells you lose as SD becomes depleted and
you control fewer and fewer swords feels like an exercise in madness.
Just assume you have access to all your spells until you run out of SD,
at which point you still have blade barrier and blade strike to work
with.</p>
<p>Where do swords go as you lose control of them? I have no idea. A
half-dozen scabbards slung about your body? Pocket universe? Are they
steel or made of solid light? These are questions for you to answer.
Also, good luck climbing ropes with your feet.</p>
<h2 id="warlock"><strong>WARLOCK</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> Dagger, ragged cloak, 1d6 doses
of some very good drugs.</p>
<p><strong>A: Pact, +1ED</strong> <strong>B: Cloak of Stars,
+1ED</strong> <strong>C: Liquid Sanity, Spelleater, +1ED</strong>
<strong>D: Part The Veil, +1ED</strong></p>
<p>You gain 1 Eldritch Die (ED) for every warlock template that you
possess. Medium and Heavy Armor reduce your available ED.</p>
<p><strong>A: Pact.</strong> In exchange for powers and the promise of
forbidden knowledge you have entered into a pact with an inscrutable
entity from beyond the stars. A Warlock who breaks their pact die
screaming, lost to madness.</p>
<p>You have spell-like abilities, but they are not the same as a
wizard’s spells. To use an ability, select the number of Eldritch Dice
(ED) you wish to invest, roll them, and add the numbers together. Pick
abilities from the list below at the appropriate template level. Some
Warlocks attempt to bargain for even more abilities with their
patrons…</p>
<p>Most abilities depend on the number of [dice] invested and the [sum]
they show.</p>
<p><strong>B: Cloak of Stars.</strong> Your clothes are imbued with the
darkness of unreality. Unknown constellations drift across the inner
surface of your cloak. You gain +1 AC for each Warlock template that you
possess after A (Max +3). Does not work if you wear any inflexible
material (all armor).</p>
<p><strong>C: Liquid Sanity.</strong> Take 1 point of Wisdom damage and
add +1 MD to a warlock ability. If any MD roll a 6, roll an additional
d6. Continue rolling additional dice until you roll something other than
a 6.</p>
<p>The extra dice count towards Mishaps and Dooms. Mishaps and Dooms
cause an additional 1d6 damage.</p>
<p>Make a Wisdom save after your next Good Night’s Rest to regain each
lost point of Wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>C: Spelleater.</strong> When an enemy targets you with a
spell or spell-like ability, make a WIS save as a free reaction to
direct the spell back at the caster. Invest 2ED to double the effect
(duration, damage, etc.) and 3ED to triple it.</p>
<p><strong>D: Part The Veil.</strong> Pierce the membrane between worlds
and expose the target(s) to the unblinking gaze of your master beyond
the stars. This ability has three applications:</p>
<p><strong>WARLOCK ABILITIES</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Scuttle</strong></p>
<p><em>R: self, T: self, D: [sum] rounds</em></p>
<p>Dozens of tiny mouths open in the calloused soles of your feet. You
can move at full speed in any orientation and freely rotate as you move.
Climb or walk up any solid surface as well as a spider could, even
upside-down.</p>
<p>This ability is the reason why a Warlock’s hoary feet are always
shoeless, filthy, and wrapped in dirty rags.</p>
<p><strong>A. Piercing Insight</strong></p>
<p>R: 25’, T: creature, D: 0</p>
<p>[Dice] gnashing maws appear around the target ripping thought and
memory from their mind.</p>
<p>Use 1 ED to learn the current and max HP of the target. Use 2 ED to
also learn of any resistances or vulnerabilities. At 3 ED you also know
of any special abilities they might have. 4ED will further reveal any
spells the target may know or templates they possess.</p>
<p><strong>B. Hymn of The Stars</strong></p>
<p>R: 100’, T: [dice] creatures, D: concentration</p>
<p>A rift in space-time opens and the Stellar Choir pours forth a
cacophony of discordant sound. <strong>CON save</strong> or be
<strong>Stunned</strong> for [sum] rounds. Creatures that fail their
save may attempt another at the start of each of their turns with a
-[dice] modifier to the roll.</p>
<p><strong>B. Eldritch Blast</strong></p>
<p><em>R: 200’, T: creature, D: 0</em></p>
<p>Target takes [sum] + [dice] damage, no Save. As a Warlock, your spell
is an oscillating current of eldritch fluid, throwing off globs of
energy that spit and sizzle on the ground like hot grease from a frying
pan.</p>
<p><strong>C. Cerebral Dredge</strong></p>
<p>R: touch, T: Creature, D: concentration</p>
<p>Make a <strong>WIS save</strong> to rummage a creature’s mind like a
midden heap. Target recalls the desired memory you designate in perfect
detail (“the first time you met your wife”, “where you buried the
treasure”). The creature will be lost in a reverie for [sum] rounds.
This reverie ends if the creature is attacked, threatened, or has to
perform any action.</p>
<p>This memory may induce a Fear or Morale test. It must be specific.
“The scariest thing you have ever seen” would not work, but “the night
your village burned” would.</p>
<p><strong>C: Thrash.</strong> This ability triggers as a free action
when struck by a melee attack. You must invest ED in this ability.</p>
<p>A writhing mass of tentacles erupt from your abdomen lashing out at
enemies within 15’ of you. [Dice] targets are flung [dice]x5’ in a
random direction and take [sum] damage. Targets make a <strong>DEX
save</strong> with a -[dice] modifier for half damage and avoid being
thrown.</p>
<p><strong>D. Time is a Flat Circle</strong></p>
<p><em>R: self, T: self, D: dice</em></p>
<p>Decouple yourself from linear time for [dice] rounds. To those around
you you appear as several blurry versions of yourself, all moving out of
sync with one another. Gain +4 AC.</p>
<p>Your movement speed doubles and your may perform an extra action each
round. You cannot use other Warlock powers in this state but you can
otherwise act normally.</p>
<p>There is a 1-in-6 chance +[dice] that as you reenter the normal flow
of time something will follow you. Ex.: A space amoeba made of teeth and
slime with [Dice] slashing pseudopods (1d6 damage). HP is is
[sum]+10).</p>
<p><strong>WARLOCK MISHAPS</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>ED only return to your pool on a 1-2 until your next Good Night’s
Rest.</p></li>
<li><p>Receive a minor side-quest from the Old Ones. You have 1d6 days
to complete it or suffer a Doom.</p></li>
<li><p>Eldritch tentacles explode out of you causing [sum] damage in a
20’ radius. DEX Save for half damage. You are fine.</p></li>
<li><p>Screaming for 1d6 rounds.</p></li>
<li><p>Eaten by portal, reappear in 1d12 rounds from a surprising
location.</p></li>
<li><p>Summon a Star Baby; It is not friendly (Referees: Just Use
Bears).</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>DOOM OF THE WARLOCK</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Lost to Madness for 1d4 days. Incapacitated.</p></li>
<li><p>A rival Alien Intelligence has noticed you. You are hunted by
it’s corporeal minions (the Henchmen from Miyazaki’s Howl’s Moving
Castle would be great for this).</p></li>
<li><p>You have failed to meet the terms of your Pact in a timely
manner. Your consciousness is shunted out into the cold void between the
stars, and your body becomes the vessel for a twisted alien
intelligence.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Your parents were horrible people…</p>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment</strong>: An edgy black Leather Armor, a
Trident, a Cloak to hide your features.</p>
<p>For every Tiefling template you have, you gain a Magic Dice and
reveal one of your <strong>Parent’s Sins</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A: Maleficence, Eugnot, Parent’s Sin A</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Consume Soul, Parent’s Sin B</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Hellforged, Parent’s Sin C, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Cambion, Parent’s Sin D</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Maleficence.</strong> You start with the Maleficence
spell. It is stored in your Psyche and you spend Spell Dice to cast it.
Choose an element for it.</p>
<p><strong>Maleficence</strong> R: 120’</p>
<p>Your maleficence is unique and reflects your own essence: It’s an
outpour of magic that inflicts [sum]+[dice] damage to one target. When
you choose this spell, decide which type of damage it will inflict and
how. You might find different types of Maleficences during your
adventures and learn them.</p>
<p>Every time you roll doubles you get closer to
<strong>Catastrophe</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catastrophe:</strong> Every time you roll doubles you gain 1
<strong>Doom Point</strong>. Every time you gain a Doom Point, roll a
D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a
catastrophe.</p>
<p>A character could roll a D6 the first time they a catasrophy and
increase the dice size each time, rerolled results they already had. But
you could embrace the chaos and roll a D12 all the time.</p>

<h2 id="many-goblins"><strong>MANY GOBLINS</strong></h2>
<p>NOTE: This class template requires the Goblin ancestry but could
easily be adapated to other small folk that operate in swarms.</p>
<p>Many Goblins act as one character. There are a lot of them (though
the exact amount seems to vary from scene to scene) and they contribute
about as much as one actual character (at best). They are a bunch of
goblins milling about in the back of the scene, doing goblin things,
kind of half-paying attention, and mostly serving as colorful
detail.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> many daggers, filthy rags,
fleas, etc. Roll for 1 random item from the Dungeoneering Table.</p>
<p><strong>A: Shared Totals</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: +1 Goblin Warlord</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: +1 Goblin Warlord, Use Thing, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: +1 Goblin Warlord, New Thing</strong></p>
<p>Many Goblins gain +2 HP every level. If this would take them over 20
HP, they instead split into Two Many Goblins and lose half their maximum
HP. One half runs away.</p>
<p><strong>A: Shared Totals.</strong> Many Goblins have a shared HP pool
just like a normal character. Every point of damage causes a single
goblin to die in an inconsequential background sort of way. Area of
affect attacks and traps only affect them once. Single-target Save or
Die effects instead cause Many Goblins to lose 1 HP. Other single-target
spells usually affect all the goblins. Mutations might affect all the
goblins or become a Thing they can use (see Use Thing below).</p>
<p>Somehow they consume the same ration as one person.</p>
<p>If Many Goblins are reduced to 0 HP, they become strewn about the
place, wounded and moaning, miserable and unable to help anyone until
healed. If they are reduced below 0 HP they all die in a suitably
tragic-comic fashion. The only survivors will be the Goblin Warlords
(see below).</p>
<p>Many Goblins have 5 inventory slots total. They can carry more things
but they will inevitably lose, smash, ruin, sell, or eat all but 5
items. Weapons and armor are carried separately and do not occupy
inventory slots. In order to gain any benefit from a weapon, armor set,
or magic item, Many Goblins need 10 copies. Give them 10 swords and they
deal sword damage, etc.</p>
<p>They spend money collectively and irresponsibly.</p>
<p>If you need to determine exactly how Many Goblins are present, roll
1d12+6. This number varies encounter to encounter and even round to
round. When performing basic unskilled labour, like digging a trench or
carrying buckets, Many Goblins count as 10 people for the first hour, 5
people the next hour, and give up after the third hour. They occupy an
area 20’ square whenever possible, spreading as needed (a 5’ wide 80’
long line, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>B: Goblin Warlord.</strong> One goblin in the swarm has
earned a name. Once per encounter, for one round, the named goblin can
do something different than the other Many Goblins. They could run to
warn the PCs while the rest of the Many Goblins fight something. At the
end of the round, the Goblin Warlord is absorbed back into the swarm.
Goblin Warlords get a name and a very short description like, “has a
horned helmet” or “smells of cheese.”</p>
<p>If the Many Goblins die, each Goblin Warlord becomes a Level 1 Goblan
with no bonuses, the stats of the Many Goblans, and 2 HP. If the Goblin
Warlord finds some more goblins, or spend some time in an area where
goblins are likely to be found, they can recombine to form a new Level 2
Many Goblans. Only 1 Goblin Warlord survives this process. You can use
orphans, urchins, drunkards, wastrels, and particularly cunning feral
dogs to fill out the ranks. Goblinism is contagious.</p>
<p><strong>C: Use Thing.</strong> Many Goblins can now be given magic
items or special tools.</p>
<p>They can use them once per encounter, collectively. This could be a
Goblin Warlord action. The goblin with the magic wand fires it, the
goblin with the serrated weasel-thrower uses it, then steps back into
the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>D: New Thing.</strong> Many Goblins gain a special 6th
inventory slot that contains a random item rolled on the Random General
Gear A or B Table. Roll the item randomly each encounter. If the Many
Goblins run into another room or out of sight (one round at least) and
then run back (a second round) they can reroll the item.</p>
<h2 id="surly-gnome"><strong>SURLY GNOME</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> you must be a Gnome. You cannot choose
Template A from this class unless you have Template A from another class
(so, effectively, you can’t enter this class until you are 2nd
level).</p>
<p><strong>A: Brawler, Invective </strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Heard fo Me?, Feck Off!</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Powerful Hat, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Gnome Rage, Truculence</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Brawler.</strong> Your unarmed attacks deal 1d6+STR
damage. Gain a +2 bonus to Strength for the purposes of grappling and
shoving.</p>
<p><strong>A: Invective.</strong> You love to hurl colorful invectives
at people around you. Gain a +2 Charisma bonus on intimidation attempts
when creatures can understand you.</p>
<p><strong>B: Heard of Me?</strong> Your reputation precedes you (with
justice or not). Ordinary citizens in towns are scared of you. 1/3
chance there is a bounty on your head when you enter a town.</p>
<p><strong>B: Feck Off!</strong> If you pass a Save vs Fear, you may
immediately make an attack against whatever caused you to Save. You can
use a weapon, a spell, a thrown object, your fists, etc. You cannot draw
a weapon or prepare an item before attacking; it must be immediate.</p>
<p><strong>C: Powerful Hat.</strong> Once per day, you can remove your
red felt cap and use it to negate an incoming ranged attack. The target
must be you, an adjacent ally, or the area you are standing in. The
arrow, spell, flying rock, etc. vanishes into your hat. Write down
everything your hat eats. When you die, it will all come spraying back
out.</p>
<p><strong>D: Gnome Rage.</strong> You gain a second attack per round if
you are fighting with a dagger or your bare fists. Other suitably
close-and- personal weapons may be acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>D: Truculence.</strong> You are immune to any spells or
effects that would alter your natural disposition, goals, or views, from
charm spells to total perspective vortices.</p>
<h2 id="glade-elf"><strong>GLADE ELF</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> bow, 20 arrows, dagger, 50’ of
rope. You cannot wear heavy armor.</p>
<p><strong>A: Glade &amp; Glen, Star Eyed</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Evasion, Uncanny</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Old Tongue, Nimble, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Forest Walker, Inhuman Accuracy, Extra Attack</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Glade &amp; Glen.</strong> You are attuned to the living
spirits all around you in stoic rock, burbling stream, and wolf’s red
ripping mouth. They whisper in your ear, a never-quiet babble, always
vying for your attention.</p>
<p>You are sly and wily. Gain +2 to Move Silently &amp; Unseen.</p>
<p>You move through the landscape without leaving a trace, and the
natural world conspires with you in this. When traveling through a
wilderness alone or with other elves you cannot be tracked and you gain
+2 when rolling to avoid surprise.</p>
<p><strong>A: Star Eyed.</strong> Elves treat starlight as sunlight. If
they can see the stars, they can see as well as they can during the day.
You can do the spooky head turn thing like an owl. You effectively have
360-degree vision.</p>
<p>This doesn’t help in dark, underground dungeons, but is helpful in
the wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>B: Evasion.</strong> You have advantage on DEX saves vs
attacks, as long as you can see the attack coming. If success would 1⁄2
the damage, you instead take no damage.</p>
<p>Treat fall distance as half for determining damage.</p>
<p><strong>B: Uncanny.</strong> You can sense (but not see) invisible
creatures within 15ft. This lets you pinpoint their location. You also
get a sense of their movements, so if they are moving their limbs, you
can attack them without penalty.</p>
<p><strong>C: Old Tongue.</strong> You speak the secret language of
rocks, trees, and animals. You have +2 on reaction rolls when speaking
to an animal, copse of trees, mushroom colony, or mountain for the first
time.</p>
<p>These things can answer questions you may ask assuming they know what
you are talking about, but any knowledge they share will be from an
alien perspective that is hard for humanoids to make sense of.</p>
<p><strong>C: Nimble.</strong> You gain +2 on rolls to perform the
following combat maneuvers: disarm and feint.</p>
<p>On a critical hit you may make an immediate follow-up attack against
your foe or another enemy within range of your weapon.</p>
<p>If you did not move this round, or if you split movement, you may
make a full move to engage a second target. Reducing them to 0HP
triggers this ability again.</p>
<p>Your maximum number of follow-up actions is limited to the number of
Elf template that you possess.</p>
<p>As per the critical success rule, the first follow-up attack or
combat maneuver is rolled with advantage.</p>
<p><strong>D: Forest Walker.</strong> You gain the ability to leave
mystical messages on trees, rocks, ponds, or any other natural unworked
object. Only others with the Forest Walker ability can read these
messages and you must communicate with mental images rather than written
words or runes.</p>
<p>You also gain the ability to step inside a tree to avoid
starvation/thirst/extreme weather or restore your health. It takes 1 day
to regain 1 HP in this way as you draw water and nutrients from the
soil.</p>
<p>When you enter a tree you may exit from another tree as long as you
have line-of-sight to it from the ground.</p>
<p>Dryads have either the best or worst possible response to you [50/50
odds] when making a reaction roll.</p>
<p><strong>D: Inhuman Accuracy.</strong> Your arrows appear to twist and
turn in flight like a bird. You ignore the penalty for shooting into
melee combat and there is no risk of hitting allies.</p>
<p><strong>NOTES ON THE ELF</strong></p>
<p>Elves are at home in the wilds of the world. They are renowned for
their wood-craft, and can move silently when stalking through the
forest, disturbing neither twig nor leaf.</p>
<p>At times they are merry, and take great delight in dances and
parties, which they will hold in the middle of forests, enwrapped in
multi-colored lights. Other times, they are grim as aged kings.</p>
<p>They keep their own laws, which are ancient and unknown to mortal
men. Their ways are strange. In truth, the Elves are like a force of
nature – they embody the gentle spring rain, the summer’s thunderstorm,
the calm of autumn and the bleakness of winter.</p>

<h2 id="gnoll-huntmaster"><strong>GNOLL HUNTMASTER</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> light armor, spear, trap.</p>
<p><strong>A: Hunter, Sensitive Nose , +1 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Laughing Gnoll, Grandmother’s Wisdom, +1 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Sneaky, Pack Hunter, +1 HP, +1 To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Hyena, Dark Blood, +1 HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Hunter</strong>. You have <strong>advantage</strong> on
saves to track your chosen quarry.</p>
<p><strong>A: Sensitive Nose.</strong> You gain the <strong>Improved
Smell</strong> ability. You have a keen nose and can determine the
location of creatures within a 25ft radius around you (as long as there
is not too much wind!).</p>
<p><strong>B: Laughing Gnoll</strong>. 1/per day, you can use your
laughter to force a morale check on a group of enemies.</p>
<p><strong>B: Grandmother’s Wisdom</strong>. 1/per day, you can cast
bones to receive an omen about a course of action you are about to take
(Weal/Woe/Neutral).</p>
<p><strong>C: Pack Stalker.</strong> When you <strong>Gang Up</strong>
on an enemy, you receive <strong>advantage</strong> on your initial
attack.</p>
<p><strong>C: Sneaky.</strong> You have advantage on <strong>DEX
saves</strong> made to move silently and unseen.</p>
<p><strong>D: Hyena</strong>. You gain a Hyena follower.</p>
<p><strong>D: Breath Like Honey</strong>. You smell of honey and savory
things. 1/per day, you can use your breath to try to Charm a creature
within 30 ft of you. <strong>Save vs CHA</strong> and impose the
<strong>Charmed</strong> condition.</p>
<h2 id="grudgekeeper"><strong>GRUDGEKEEPER</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> You must be a Dwarf.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> Light armor, a 1-handed weapon
&amp; shield or a 2-handed weapon, small fermentation cask* (1 slot),
half-filled book of grudges</p>
<p><strong>A: Iron Gut, Stone Sight, +2HP</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: Roots of The Mountain, Magnificent Beard</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Handy if Not Handsome, Stone Cunning, +2 HP, +1
To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: Obsessive, Stubborn</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Iron Gut</strong>. Raised on a diet of iron sausage,
fungus jerky, and albino cave mollusks, dwarves can eat just about
anything organic as long as they let it ferment in their “beer” cask for
48 hours and consume it as a mostly liquid slurry.</p>
<p>You have Advantage on saves vs poison.</p>
<p><strong>B: Stone Sight.</strong> You see clearly in dim light. Light
brighter than moonlight or candlelight negates. In complete darkness
(windowless room, dungeon, deep cave, etc.) dwarves use sonic throat
singing, providing them a sort of sonar that lets them see 30’ as if it
were dimly lit. Moving silently &amp; unseen is impossible when using
these vocalizations.</p>
<p><strong>B: Grudge.</strong> If someone insults, slights, or injures
you, the Grudgekeeper can start to hold a <strong>grudge</strong>
against that type of creature. While holding a grudge, the PC gains +1
to damage and checks to confront the creature, but has to <strong>save
vs. WIS</strong> to pursue a peaceful confrontation. Your grudge remains
active for 1 week.</p>
<p><strong>B: Magnificent Beard.</strong> Gain +1 item slots for every
Grudgekeeper Dwarf template that you possess.</p>
<p>These slots are inside the dwarf’s beard. They count as additional
quick draw slots. They cannot be found without shaving the dwarf.</p>
<p><strong>C: Handy if Not Handsome.</strong> As long as you have basic
tools you can make significant repairs to a single object overnight. If
a shield has been sundered or spear broken, you can repair them with a
single night of work. You don’t even need sleep when you work: your
obsession is refreshing.</p>
<p><strong>C: Stone Cunning.</strong> You know when all the secret doors
in a dungeon level have been found.</p>
<p>By tasting and nibbling the stone of a room you can determine if
there are any traps nearby, though not their exact location.</p>
<p><strong>D: Deep Grudge.</strong> Pick one type of creature and
develop a permanent grudge against it. You cannto refuse a challenge or
opportunity to best that type of creature. Once per day, you can shrug
off a spell or damage roll from the creature you hold a grudge
against.</p>
<p><strong>D: Stubborn.</strong> You get so stubborn that even spells
stop affecting you. You are now a magic null zone. Magic of any kind,
both good and bad, cannot work on you directly. Shaving your beard
cancels this ability.</p>
<p>NOTES ON THE DWARF</p>
<p>A dwarf is an obsessive creature. He loves to create. When he
discovers what craft most interests him, he dedicates himself completely
to it.</p>
<p>His hours are spent perfecting his craft, innovating in his craft,
critiquing examples of his craft, and tearing it all down so he can
start again and do it right this time.</p>
<p>Really, drinking is the only thing that keeps a dwarf steady. It
evens him out, mellows him down, lets his mind work on problems that
aren’t exclusively about his craftwork.</p>
<p>All this obsessiveness pays off. Dwarf-craft is both practical and
beautiful. It is highly sought after, which makes them rich.</p>
<p>This is important for dwarves, who know the purpose of life:
construct your tomb, because that’s where you’re going to spend the rest
of eternity. Woe to the dwarf whose ghost goes into the afterlife bored.

<h2 id="hearty-halfling"><strong>HEARTY HALFLING</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> You need to be a halfling.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> light armor, cooking gear, a
dagger that you insist is a sword.</p>
<p><strong>A: Second Breakfast, Nimble Hands &amp; Feet</strong></p>
<p><strong>B: A Few Good Taters, Luck of the Small Folk</strong></p>
<p><strong>C: Simple Pleasures, “Get Off The Road!”, +1
To-Hit</strong></p>
<p><strong>D: A Nose For Trouble , Shifty Wee Bugger</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Second Breakfast.</strong> Also known as the Elevenses. A
halfling is always hungry. Ravenously hungry. You consume twice as much
food as other creatures.</p>
<p>If you are unable to consume 4 rations per day -twice the norm-
<strong>save vs Constitution</strong> once per hour until you have eaten
or gain a level of fatigue.</p>
<p>As long as you are not fatigued, you can reroll a Crit Failure
1/day.</p>
<p><strong>A: Nimble Hands &amp; Feet.</strong> Hobbits “seldom [wear]
shoes, since their feet [have] tough leathery soles and [are] clad in a
thick curling hair, much like the hair of their heads, which was
commonly brown.” -JRR Tolkien</p>
<p>You gain advantage on checks to move silently and unseen when
traveling alone, with other hobbits, or similarly stealthy Big Folk.</p>
<p>Gain +2 on DEX saves to disable traps and pick locks.</p>
<p><strong>B: A Few Good Taters.</strong> You’ve learned to prepare and
preserve the flora and fauna of the dungeon to keep the Elevenses at
bay. Create an addition 1d4 rations from any monsters that you butcher.
Rations last an additional day.</p>
<p>Magical monsters are particularly enticing as they count as
double-rations for hobbits.</p>
<p>Make an INT Save to determine the medicinal and culinary qualities of
unfamiliar ingredients, potions, and similar concoctions.</p>
<p>The INT Save also allows you to tell if an ingredient will be
outright poisonous to eat.</p>
<p>Keeping a recipe book of these discoveries negates the need for the
INT Save in the future, but only if the player keeps notes.</p>
<p><strong>B: Luck of the Small Folk.</strong> 1/day reroll any failed
save.</p>
<p><strong>C: “Get Off The Road!”.</strong> Any time an attack allows a
DEX Save for 1⁄2 damage, and you succeed, you take no damage.</p>
<p><strong>C: Simple Pleasures.</strong> If you can pair a meal with
alcohol and a goof pipe of Old Toby weed you regain an additional 1D4 HP
from Lunch.</p>
<p><strong>D: A Nose For Treasure.</strong> You can smell objects of
value the way a dwarf can smell ore hidden deep in the rocks.</p>
<p>This doesn’t specifically mean that you can smell treasure, though
you can. The things you can sniff out are cherished by someone, is one-
of-a-kind, or simply very rare and valuable.</p>
<p>You must be in or adjacent to the area containing “treasure” for this
to work. It is not a passive ability -you must actively engage your
senses.</p>
<p>If a child’s beloved toy and the crown of an ancient king are both
hidden in the same room you will detect the item that was most loved
(not coveted).</p>
<p><strong>D: Shifty Wee Bugger.</strong> When a larger enemy misses you
with a melee attack, you may force them to make another melee attack
against a target within range. It’s possible to make enemies hit
themselves with this ability.</p>
<p>Alternatively, on your next turn gain advantage if you choose to
perform a combat maneuver.</p>
